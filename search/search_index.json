This happens because the Parent kernel continues executing immediately after launching the Child, without waiting.

Even if the hardware has space, the second child kernel won't start until the first one finishes. This is shown on the left side of Slide 20, where K0 through K7 run one after another.</p>"},{"location":"UIUC/ECE408.html#24","title":"24","text":"<p>Guest lecture by Katrina Riehl, Principal Technical Product Manager, NVIDIA: The CUDA Python Developer\u2019s Toolbox</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"UIUC/ECE408.html#25-advanced-optimizations-improving-attention","title":"25 Advanced Optimizations-Improving Attention","text":""},{"location":"UIUC/ECE408.html#attention","title":"Attention","text":""},{"location":"UIUC/ECE408.html#overview-why-optimize-attention","title":"Overview: Why Optimize Attention?","text":"<p>The lecture focuses on the \"Attention\" mechanism, which is the bottleneck in Large Language Model (LLM) inference. \u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u74f6\u9888 * The Bottleneck: Attention scales quadratically \\(O(T^2)\\) with sequence length. * The Hardware Reality: For large sequences (\\(100k+\\) tokens), creating and moving a \\(T \\times T\\) matrix between Global Memory (HBM) and On-Chip Memory (SRAM) is too slow.</p>"},{"location":"UIUC/ECE408.html#1-flash-attention-kernel-fusion-tiling","title":"1.

Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its root or base form (e.g., \"connecting,\" \"connected\" -&gt; \"connect\").</li> <li>SHRDLU (1970): An early NLP program created by Terry Winograd at MIT. It operated in a simulated \"blocks world\" and could understand and execute commands in natural English like \"pick up the big red block and put it on the green one.\" It was a landmark example of \"deep\" understanding within a very limited domain.</li> <li>Zork transcript (late 1970s): A classic text-based adventure game. It was notable for its relatively sophisticated text parser that could understand more complex commands than its contemporaries, making the game feel more interactive and intelligent.</li> <li>Pattern Playback (1950s): A device developed at Haskins Laboratories that converted visual patterns of speech (spectrograms) back into sound \u5c06\u58f0\u8c31\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u56de\u58f0\u97f3.

In fact, pronoun use is a better marker of depression than the use of negative emotion words like \"sad\" or \"angry\".</li> <li>Poets who committed suicide used \"I\" at significantly higher rates than non-suicidal poets, suggesting greater self-focus and less social integration.</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Reactions to Stress</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Individual Stress: When facing personal crises (divorce, cancer diagnosis), Mayor Rudy Giuliani's use of \"I\" words shot up from about 2% to over 7%. This shows that personal distress often leads to an intense focus on the self.</li> <li>Shared Stress: After the 9/11 attacks, the opposite happened. People's use of \"I\" words dropped, while their use of first-person plural pronouns (\"we,\" \"us\") increased. This suggests that a shared tragedy causes people to focus less on themselves and more on their community and social connections.</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Honesty and Deception</li> </ol> <ul> <li>When people are telling the truth, they tend to use more first-person singular pronouns (\"I\") and more exclusive words (e.g., \"but,\" \"except,\" \"without\").</li> <li>This suggests that truthful accounts are more personal and cognitively complex, while lies are simpler and more detached.</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Social Status</li> </ol> <ul> <li>In a conversation, the person with higher status consistently uses fewer \"I\" words.</li> <li>For example, in his conversations, President Nixon used \"I\" far less when speaking to his subordinates John Dean and John Erlichman than they did when speaking to him16.

Building long enough phrase tables is still a challenge. The dimensionality of our features grows with the number of categories. However, there is no need to consider all of the categories when we model the interactions. For this reason, one might only consider a fixed number of categories for each bounding box. We speculate that the relations between attributes and objects, parts and objects, visual phrases and scenes, and objects and visual phrases mirror one another.

It involved 20 different LLMs and 39 tasks across three benchmarks (LMENTRY, BIG-bench Lite (BBL), and BIG-bench Hard (BBH)). Performance Variation The performance and relative ranking of models vary widely with prompt phrasing. Ranking Instability Kendall's W (measuring ranking correlation across prompts) was generally smaller than 0.85 for most tasks, indicating weak to moderate agreement in model rankings. Divergence The performance on the original, single instruction often deviated by more than one standard deviation from the average performance across all paraphrases (a phenomenon called 'divergence'). Minimal Edits Even minor phrasing changes (e.g., substituting 'excludes' with 'lacks') resulted in large and often opposite performance changes across different models. Proposed Metrics The paper proposes distinct metrics for different use cases: MaxP (Maximum Performance) The maximum score a model achieves across all instruction templates (\\(\\max_{i\\in I_{T}}\\epsilon(M,T,i)\\)). This is useful for downstream application developers looking to find the single best prompt. AvgP (Average Performance) The mean score across all templates. This is useful for LLM developers to measure robustness to instruction paraphrasing. CPS (Combined Performance Score) \\(CPS = Sat \\cdot MaxP\\).

Previous procedural methods were limited by requiring specific heuristics (e.g., 'vehicles should drive along lane centerlines'), which creates a sim2real content gap. Generation Process The model sequentially inserts actors (vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists) one at a time. It is conditioned on the ego-vehicle state and an High Definition map (HD map). Model Architecture Uses a Recurrent Neural Network based on the ConvLSTM architecture to capture long-range dependencies. Actor Parameterization Each actor \\(a_i\\) is parameterized by: class label (\\(c_i\\)), location (\\(x_i, y_i\\)), bounding box (\\(b_i\\), including size and heading \\(\\theta_i\\)), and velocity (\\(v_i\\)).

Why go through the latent space? Why not learn to transform directly from a Gaussian in R^n to images in the same \\(R^n\\) space?</p> <p>Why the Latent Space is Crucial?</p> <p>The \"bottleneck\" created by the lower-dimensional latent space forces the VAE to learn the most important, underlying features of the data.2 Instead of just memorizing the input, it must learn an efficient code to represent it. Here are the key advantages of this approach:</p> <ul> <li>Learning a Meaningful Representation: The latent space isn't just a random collection of numbers; it's an organized, continuous space where similar data points are located near each other.3 This structure allows you to perform powerful operations, like interpolating between two images by simply moving between their corresponding points in the latent space.4</li> <li>Generating New Data: Because the latent space is structured and continuous, you can sample a random point from the Gaussian distribution it was trained on, pass it through the decoder, and generate a completely new, realistic image. This is the generative power of a VAE.</li> <li>Dealing with the Curse of Dimensionality: Image space is incredibly high-dimensional. A direct mapping from a high-dimensional Gaussian to the image space would be extremely difficult to learn. The model would have to navigate a vast, mostly empty space to find the tiny region that contains realistic images. The latent space provides a much smaller, more manageable space for the model to work in.</li> <li>Encouraging Disentanglement: A well-trained VAE can learn a \"disentangled\" latent space, where different dimensions of the latent vector correspond to distinct, interpretable features of the image.5 For example, in a VAE trained on faces, one dimension might control smile, another might control the angle of the head, and a third could control hair color.6 This makes the model more interpretable and controllable.</li> </ul> <p>In short, the latent space is not just a detour; it's a fundamental component that allows VAEs to be powerful generative models. It forces the network to learn the essence of the data rather than just its superficial appearance.</p> <p>Intuition: Thermodynamics</p> <p>Add noise to destroy structure of the image &lt;=&gt; Learn

the following buffer management problem. Initially the buffer size (the number of blocks) is one. Each block can accommodate exactly one item. As soon as a new item arrives, check if there is an available block. If yes, put the item into the block, induced a cost of one. Otherwise, the buffer size is doubled, and then the item is able to put into. Moreover, the old items have to be moved into the new buffer so it costs k+1 to make this insertion, where k is the number of old items. Clearly, if there are N items, the worst-case cost for one insertion can be \u03a9(N). To show that the average cost is O(1), let us turn to the amortized analysis. To simplify the problem, assume that the buffer is full after all the N items are placed. Which of the following potential functions works?</p> <p>A. The number of items currently in the bufferB.

At this specific moment in the timing diagram, both inputs A and B are high (1).</p> <p>Ideal vs. Real Behavior: Ideally, when S changes from 1 to 0, the output Y should switch from following A to following B. Since both A and B are high, Y should remain high.</p> <p>Inverter Delay: However, the inverter which generates S\u02c9 (the inverted version of S) has a delay (indicated as 0.2 time units in the diagram).</p> <p>Race Condition:</p> <p>When S goes from 1 to 0:</p> <ul> <li>The signal S = 0 arrives quickly at the input of the top AND gate, disabling it.</li> <li>The signal S\u02c9 remains 0 for a short time (0.2 units) due to the inverter's delay before it becomes 1.</li> <li>During this short delay period, both S and S\u02c9 are effectively 0 at the inputs of their respective AND gates.</li> </ul> <p>Output Drops: With both AND gates receiving a 0 on their select inputs (S = 0 for the top, S\u02c9 = 0 temporarily for the bottom), both AND gates output 0.</p> <p>Glitch Formation: Since both inputs to the final OR gate are 0, its output Y drops to 0.

It's similar to a pointer,  but with a few key differences.</p> <ol> <li>Definition and Declaration:    - A reference is declared using the <code>&amp;</code> symbol. For example, <code>A&amp; ref = obj;</code>, where obj is an existing object of class A.    - Once a reference is initialized to an object, it cannot be made to refer to another object; it remains an alias to that specific object throughout its scope. \u521d\u59cb\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u8be5\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u522b\u540d\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u518d\u6210\u4e3a\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5f15\u7528\uff08\u4e0d\u53ef\u6539\u53d8\uff09</li> <li>Behavior and Usage:    - A reference must be initialized when it is declared.

Instead, it is a hybrid approach that lies somewhere between black-box testing and white-box testing. Here are several reasons why \"gray-box testing\" is often said to lack a strict meaning:</p> <ol> <li>Ambiguous Definition:</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Black-box testing focuses on testing the software's inputs and outputs, without considering the internal implementation details of the software. Testers design test cases based solely on functional requirements and specifications.</li> <li>White-box testing focuses on testing the internal logic and structure of the software. Testers need to have knowledge of the source code and test paths, branches, and internal structures.</li> </ul> <p>Gray-box testing does not have a clear, universally accepted definition. It typically refers to testing in which the tester has partial knowledge of the internal architecture or code (such as API or database structure) but does not need to fully understand the code itself. This definition is somewhat vague and lacks clear boundaries, which is why it is not considered a strict or formal testing type.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Fusion of Black-box and White-box Testing \u9ed1\u76d2\u4e0e\u767d\u76d2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u878d\u5408:       Gray-box testing essentially combines features of both black-box and white-box testing. Testers generally design test cases based on some internal information of the system, such as architecture or APIs, but without fully understanding the source code. Thus, gray-box testing cannot be strictly categorized as either white-box or black-box testing; it is a blend of both.</p> </li> <li> <p>Execution-Level Hybrid:</p> </li> </ol> <ul> <li>In practice, gray-box testing is often carried out by testers who have some knowledge of the internal system design, like APIs, databases, or system architecture, while still focusing on the external functionality of the software. This makes it a compromise between having no knowledge of the system and having full knowledge of the code.</li> <li>However, strictly speaking, black-box testing and white-box testing have well-defined boundaries: black-box testing disregards internal details, while white-box testing requires full understanding of internal implementation. Gray-box testing cannot clearly specify \"how much internal information is enough,\" which makes it harder to define strictly.</li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Confusion with Different Definitions:       Different organizations or industries may use the term \"gray-box testing\" with varying interpretations, adding to the confusion. In some contexts, gray-box testing may refer to having some understanding of external interfaces or database structures, while in other cases, it may imply a deeper understanding of system architecture. This lack of consistency leads to a blurred line of what constitutes gray-box testing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Flexibility in Testing Approach:       Since gray-box testing emphasizes partial knowledge of the system\u2019s internal structure while combining aspects of black-box and white-box testing, it is highly flexible in practical scenarios. Due to the absence of a standardized definition, many testing teams view it more as a methodological compromise or flexible application rather than a strictly defined, formal testing type.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#acceptance-test-system-test-granularity","title":"Acceptance test\uff08\u7528\u6237\u9a8c\u6536\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u548c system test\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u7c92\u5ea6 granularity \u533a\u522b","text":"<p>From a granularity perspective, UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and System Testing are not of the same granularity.

UAT is usually performed by end users or customers, who verify if the system works as expected in real-world scenarios and if it meets business requirements. UAT focuses on the business processes and whether the system can function properly in a production-like environment.    - System Testing: System testing has a broader scope and covers the validation of the entire system\u2019s functionality and performance. It includes testing all functional components and verifying that the various parts of the system interact and integrate correctly. System testing is typically done by professional testers and aims to ensure that the system meets all technical and functional specifications, including functional, performance, security, and compatibility testing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus of Testing:    - UAT: The focus of UAT is primarily on requirements and user experience, testing whether the system meets the expectations of the end users. UAT is based on requirement documents and business workflows, and users participate to ensure the system meets their practical needs, ease of use, and whether key functions work correctly.    - System Testing: The focus of system testing is on the overall functionality and technical implementation of the system. It ensures that all technical requirements (e.g., performance, interfaces, error handling, security) are met. System testing involves validating both individual functions and the integration of those functions, testing the system under various conditions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Depth of Testing:    - UAT: The depth of UAT is generally shallow, focusing mainly on high-level business workflows and whether the system meets the user\u2019s expectations. Testers usually do not get involved with the technical details of the code but instead focus on usability, business process flow, and overall functionality.    - System Testing: System testing has a much deeper depth, covering a wide range of tests. It includes unit testing, integration testing, regression testing, and other levels of testing, examining the system\u2019s technical details to ensure all components work together in various scenarios.</p> </li> <li> <p>Testing Environment:    - UAT: User acceptance testing is typically conducted in the real-world operational environment or a simulation of it. This allows the end users to test the system in conditions that closely resemble their actual work environment.    - System Testing: System testing is typically performed in a dedicated test environment that simulates various use cases. This environment is often separate from the production environment and is designed to test the system under different conditions before deployment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test Executers:    - UAT: UAT is usually executed by end users or business representatives, who test the system based on their own practical needs and business processes.    - System Testing: System testing is typically carried out by test engineers or QA teams, who design and execute tests based on requirement and design documentation to verify the technical implementation of the system.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#_5","title":"\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5206\u7c7b","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Functionality Testing    - Corresponding McCall\u2019s Factor: Correctness    - Explanation: Functionality testing primarily verifies if the software performs the functions it is intended to do and meets the required business objectives.

They are both important in ensuring the quality and reliability of the software, but they have distinct purposes, approaches, and target audiences. Below is a detailed comparison of Alpha Testing and Beta Testing:</p> <ol> <li>Alpha Testing</li> </ol> <p>Definition: Alpha testing is the first phase of testing conducted by the development team within the organization before releasing the software to external users. It is performed in a controlled environment, usually by the internal QA team or sometimes the development team itself. Purpose: The main goal of alpha testing is to identify bugs and issues that are critical to the product\u2019s functionality. It focuses on catching errors early in the development process and ensuring that the software is stable enough to be used by external testers. Testers: Alpha testing is performed by internal testers, which can include developers, quality assurance (QA) teams, and sometimes a small group of selected end-users within the company. Environment: The testing environment for alpha testing is typically the development or staging environment, which is controlled by the organization. Focus: It generally focuses on both functional and non-functional aspects of the application, checking for correctness, usability, performance, and security issues. Duration: Alpha testing lasts for a longer period compared to beta testing. The duration can range from a few weeks to several months, depending on the complexity of the software. Outcome: The outcome of alpha testing is the identification of critical issues that need to be addressed before the software is released to a wider audience.</p> <ol> <li>Beta Testing</li> </ol> <p>Definition: Beta testing is the second phase of testing, conducted by a selected group of external users outside of the organization. It is done after alpha testing has been completed and is aimed at gathering feedback from real-world users in a real production environment. Purpose: The primary goal of beta testing is to identify any remaining issues, bugs, or usability problems that were not caught during alpha testing. It allows the software to be tested by actual end-users to see how it behaves in different environments and use cases. Testers: Beta testing is typically conducted by a group of external users, also known as \"beta testers,\" who can be either voluntary or invited by the company. These testers are often selected based on their knowledge, technical skills, or experience with similar software. Environment: The software is tested in real-world environments, meaning users install and use the software in their personal or professional settings. Focus: Beta testing focuses on user feedback, usability, and identifying any minor or subtle bugs that were not caught earlier. It also helps evaluate the overall user experience (UX) and how the software performs in diverse environments. Duration: Beta testing typically lasts for a shorter period compared to alpha testing. The duration can range from a few weeks to a month, depending on the product and the scope of testing. Outcome: The outcome of beta testing is feedback from real users, including bug reports, suggestions for improvements, and insights into how the software performs in real-world scenarios.</p> <p>Similarities Between Alpha and Beta Testing: Both are conducted before the software is officially released to the public. Both aim to improve the quality and stability of the software by identifying bugs and issues. Both require systematic reporting of issues found during testing, which are then prioritized and addressed.</p>"},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#_8","title":"\u9759\u6001\u6d4b\u8bd5 &amp; \u52a8\u6001\u6d4b\u8bd5","text":"Aspect Static Testing Dynamic Testing Test Object Software artifacts like code, documentation, and requirements.

It is often calculated as the number of defects per thousand lines of code (KLOC) or per function point. This metric is important because it helps identify the quality of the codebase. A higher defect density may indicate that the software is error-prone, while a lower defect density suggests a more stable and well-tested system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reliability       Translation: Reliability       Explanation: Reliability refers to the software's ability to function without failure under specified conditions for a specified period of time. It is often measured using metrics like Mean Time To Failure (MTTF), which calculates the average time between failures in a system. A highly reliable system ensures minimal downtime and consistent performance, which is essential for critical applications like banking, healthcare, and aerospace.</p> </li> <li> <p>Maintainability       Translation: Maintainability       Explanation: Maintainability is the ease with which software can be modified to correct defects, fulfill new requirements, or adapt to changes in the environment. High maintainability is crucial for long-term success because software systems often need updates or adjustments. Metrics for maintainability may include code modularity, complexity, and how well-documented the code is. Tools like Cyclomatic Complexity can also help assess maintainability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Testability       Translation: Testability       Explanation: Testability is the degree to which a software system can be tested effectively. This includes factors such as the availability of test cases, ease of automation, and how well the software can be verified against its specifications. Testability can be improved by designing software with clear interfaces, consistent behavior, and appropriate levels of abstraction. Automation coverage is a common metric for testability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Schedule Variance       Translation: Schedule Variance       Explanation: Schedule variance measures the difference between the planned project timeline and the actual progress. It is a critical metric for tracking project performance. Positive schedule variance indicates that the project is ahead of schedule, while negative variance suggests that the project is delayed. Keeping schedule variance under control is essential for meeting deadlines and avoiding scope creep.</p> </li> <li> <p>Critical Path Completion Rate       Translation: Critical Path Completion Rate       Explanation: This metric tracks the percentage of critical tasks completed on time. The critical path in project management refers to the sequence of tasks that determine the minimum project duration. If tasks on the critical path are delayed, the entire project will be delayed. Monitoring the completion rate helps ensure that essential tasks are completed according to the project schedule.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cost Variance       Translation: Cost Variance       Explanation: Cost variance measures the difference between the actual cost incurred in a project and the budgeted cost. Positive cost variance indicates that the project is under budget, while negative variance shows overspending. Managing cost variance is crucial for maintaining financial control over a project and ensuring its profitability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Return on Investment (ROI)       Translation: Return on Investment (ROI)       Explanation: ROI is a measure of the profitability of an investment. It compares the benefits (returns) gained from a software project to the costs incurred during its development. A high ROI indicates that the project is delivering good value for the money spent, while a low ROI suggests that the project may not be financially viable or sustainable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Productivity       Translation: Productivity       Explanation: Productivity is often measured as the amount of output (usually in terms of function points) produced per unit of input (typically measured in developer hours or work hours). A higher productivity rate indicates that the team is producing more functionality with fewer resources, suggesting better efficiency and performance. Productivity can be influenced by factors like team experience, tool support, and project management practices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Review Efficiency       Translation: Review Efficiency       Explanation: Review efficiency is the ratio of the number of issues or defects found during the review process to the total number of items checked. A higher ratio indicates that the review process is effective at identifying potential problems early, which helps improve software quality. Efficient reviews can significantly reduce the number of defects in the final product.</p> </li> <li> <p>Team Morale       Translation: Team Morale       Explanation: Team morale is a measure of the overall motivation, satisfaction, and enthusiasm of the team members. High morale often leads to better productivity, collaboration, and quality. Team morale can be gauged through surveys, interviews, or informal feedback sessions. Factors like workload, leadership, work-life balance, and recognition play a significant role in influencing morale.</p> </li> <li> <p>Communication Effectiveness       Translation: Communication Effectiveness       Explanation: Communication effectiveness refers to how accurately and promptly information is exchanged within the team and between stakeholders. Effective communication ensures that all team members are aligned, reducing misunderstandings and errors. It also plays a critical role in decision-making, problem-solving, and maintaining project focus.</p> </li> <li> <p>User Feedback       Translation: User Feedback       Explanation: User feedback is direct input from users about their experience with the software. It includes comments, suggestions, complaints, and feature requests. Regular collection of user feedback helps in improving the product by aligning it with user needs and expectations. This feedback is crucial for continuous improvement and ensuring that the software meets the target audience's requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Net Promoter Score (NPS)       Translation: Net Promoter Score (NPS)       Explanation: NPS is a metric used to measure customer loyalty. It is calculated based on the likelihood of users recommending the software to others. Users are typically asked how likely they are to recommend the product on a scale from 0 to 10. Based on their score, users are categorized as promoters, passives, or detractors. A high NPS indicates strong user loyalty and satisfaction, which can lead to increased customer retention and word-of-mouth promotion.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These metrics are essential for evaluating and improving software quality, ensuring that projects meet both functional and non-functional requirements while delivering value to users and stakeholders.</p>"},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#_13","title":"\u5708\u590d\u6742\u5ea6","text":"<p>Cyclomatic Complexity is a software metric used to measure the complexity of a program\u2019s control flow. It quantifies the number of linearly independent paths through the source code, providing an indication of how complex a program is and how difficult it might be to understand, test, or maintain. The term was introduced by Thomas J. McCabe in 1976.</p> <p>Explanation:</p> <p>Cyclomatic complexity is based on the structure of the control flow graph (CFG) of a program. In this graph:</p> <ul> <li>Nodes represent the statements or instructions in the program.</li> <li>Edges represent the flow of control between those statements.</li> </ul> <p>The cyclomatic complexity (V) can be calculated using the following formula:</p> <p>V = E - N + 2P - E is the number of edges in the control flow graph. - N is the number of nodes in the control flow graph. - P is the number of connected components (typically 1 for a single program).</p> <p>Interpretation: - Low Complexity (1-10): The program is relatively simple and easy to understand and test. - Medium Complexity (11-20): The program is moderately complex, and there may be some difficulty in understanding or testing it. - High Complexity (21 or more): The program is highly complex, which might indicate that it\u2019s difficult to understand, maintain, and test. It could be prone to errors and bugs.</p> <p>Benefits of Cyclomatic Complexity: 1. Predictability: It can be used to predict how hard the program will be to test and maintain. A high cyclomatic complexity usually correlates with a greater number of bugs and increased maintenance difficulty. 2. Test Coverage: It helps determine the minimum number of test cases needed to cover all independent paths in the program. 3. Code Quality: Reducing cyclomatic complexity can improve the readability and maintainability of the code, making it easier for developers to understand and modify.</p>"},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#-","title":"\u7f3a\u9677-\u745e\u5229\u5206\u5e03","text":"<p>In software testing, the daily number of newly discovered defects often follows a Rayleigh distribution in terms of its temporal variation. This phenomenon can be explained from a statistical perspective, as the Rayleigh distribution is commonly used to describe processes influenced by multiple factors, such as the gradual discovery of defects during software testing.</p> <p>Overview of Rayleigh Distribution: The Rayleigh distribution is a continuous probability distribution often used to describe the amplitude of random variables with symmetric and normal distributions, particularly when multiple independent, identically distributed random variables are involved. In the context of software defects, the Rayleigh distribution can model the defect discovery process, especially when the rate of discovery increases over time.</p> <p>Why the Daily Defect Discovery Follows a Rayleigh Distribution: Early Stages \u2013 Low Discovery Rate: In the initial phases of testing, the number of defects discovered is low because testers may not fully understand the system\u2019s complexity or the system has not been sufficiently tested. Middle Stages \u2013 Increasing Discovery Rate: As testing progresses, testers gain more experience and a better understanding of the system, and the test coverage expands. This results in an accelerated rate of defect discovery. Later Stages \u2013 Stabilization or Decrease: After most of the obvious defects have been found and addressed, testers may start discovering marginal or hard-to-detect defects. The rate of defect discovery slows down and stabilizes, eventually reaching a plateau or decreasing.</p> <p>Role of Rayleigh Distribution in Defect Discovery: Modeling and Prediction: The Rayleigh distribution effectively describes the dynamic process of defect discovery and can be used to predict the number of defects that might be discovered in the near future. This helps test managers make decisions on resource allocation and planning adjustments during testing. Quantifying Testing Progress: By analyzing the distribution of defect discoveries, the QA team can assess the progress of testing and the completeness of test coverage. The Rayleigh distribution shape reflects the natural process: fewer defects are found early on, followed by a more efficient discovery process, and eventually a saturation point is reached.</p>"},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#_14","title":"\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b","text":""},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#overview","title":"\u6982\u8ff0 Overview","text":"<p>Exhaustively testing all possible inputs to any nontrivial software component is generally impossible due to the enormous number of variations.

This increment is the most important outcome of the Sprint and must meet specific criteria to ensure it's potentially ready for release. Here's what the Potentially Shippable Product Increment typically includes:</p> <ol> <li>Completed and Fully Developed Features     The Product Increment must include all the user stories or features planned for that Sprint. These user stories should be completed, meaning all the tasks within them have been finished and accepted by the Product Owner (PO).     The features are considered \"done\" according to the team's Definition of Done (DoD). This includes not only the development of the feature but also any associated tasks like testing, documentation, and code reviews.</li> <li>Fully Tested     The increment must pass all types of testing defined by the team, such as unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance tests (UAT).     Testing must include both manual testing (if applicable) and automated tests to ensure that the new code works as expected and does not introduce regressions.     The tests should be completed with no major defects outstanding. If defects are found, they should be documented and ideally resolved within the same Sprint.</li> <li>Integrated with Existing System     The new features or improvements are integrated with the existing system. This ensures that the new code works well with the previously developed features and doesn\u2019t break anything in the existing product.     Any conflicts with previous functionality should be addressed and resolved, meaning that the product should be functionally stable at the end of the Sprint.</li> <li>Buildable and Deployable     The Product Increment must be in a buildable state (meaning no major build or integration issues) and deployable to a production-like environment. It should be possible to deploy the product increment at any time without requiring major changes.     This implies that all code, configurations, and dependencies are packaged in a way that the development team or operations team can push it to production if needed.</li> <li>Meets Product Owner's Acceptance Criteria     The increment must meet the acceptance criteria defined by the Product Owner for each user story or feature. The PO will review the functionality and verify that it aligns with the business needs and the goals of the Sprint.     The increment should also be aligned with the overall product vision and roadmap, providing value to the end users or stakeholders.</li> <li>Documentation (if applicable)     While Scrum emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation, any necessary documentation (like API documentation, deployment guides, etc.) should be updated as part of the increment.     The goal is to ensure that the product can be maintained, operated, and enhanced by both the development team and future teams working on it.</li> <li>Ready for Release (if necessary)     The term Potentially Shippable means that the increment is ready to be released to the customer or end users, if the decision is made to do so. However, this doesn't necessarily mean it will be released at the end of every Sprint.     In some cases, the product may not be released immediately, but it must be in a state where it could be deployed to production without further work required.</li> </ol> <p>Key Characteristics of a Potentially Shippable Product Increment:</p> <ul> <li>Quality: It must meet the agreed-upon quality standards, defined by the team\u2019s Definition of Done (DoD).</li> <li>Functional: The product must be functional, meaning all the committed features and user stories must work as expected.</li> <li>Stable: The increment should not introduce instability to the product.</li> <li>Value-Driven: The increment must deliver value to the customer, as defined in the Sprint goal and user stories.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#burn-down-chart","title":"Burn Down Chart \u71c3\u5c3d\u56fe","text":"<p>Burn Down Chart in Software Development Process and Its Application</p> <p>A Burn Down Chart is a visual tool used in Agile project management, particularly in Scrum, to track the progress of a project or sprint. It is a graphical representation that shows the remaining work (in terms of effort, time, or tasks) over time, helping teams monitor their progress towards completing a specific goal. The chart typically tracks the completion of work items, such as user stories or tasks, during a sprint or iteration.</p> <p>Structure of a Burn Down Chart A typical Burn Down Chart has the following components: 1. X-Axis (Horizontal): Represents time, usually broken down into days or iterations (e.g., sprint days). 2. Y-Axis (Vertical): Represents the amount of work remaining, which could be in the form of story points, hours, or tasks. 3. Ideal Line: A straight line that starts at the total amount of work (at the beginning of the sprint) and gradually decreases to zero as time progresses, indicating the ideal progress toward completing all tasks. 4. Actual Line: A line showing the actual remaining work at the end of each day or iteration. This line fluctuates based on the progress of the team in completing the tasks.</p> <p>How It Works - At the beginning of the sprint or project, all tasks or user stories are estimated and plotted on the Y-axis. - As work progresses, the Actual Line is updated daily to reflect the remaining work. Ideally, the actual work completed should follow the trajectory of the Ideal Line. - The chart visually displays whether the team is ahead, on track, or falling behind in terms of completing the required work.</p> <p>Applications of the Burn Down Chart</p> <ol> <li> <p>Tracking Progress:    The primary application of the Burn Down Chart is to track the progress of the team in completing the sprint or project. It gives a quick visual representation of how much work is remaining versus how much has been completed. If the Actual Line is close to the Ideal Line, it indicates that the project is on track.</p> </li> <li> <p>Identifying Potential Issues Early:    A Burn Down Chart can quickly reveal whether a team is falling behind schedule. For example, if the Actual Line is above the Ideal Line, it means the team is not completing tasks as expected. This early warning allows the team to take corrective actions, such as re-prioritizing tasks or allocating additional resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Forecasting Completion:    By tracking the burn rate (the rate at which work is completed), the Burn Down Chart can help forecast whether the team will complete the work by the end of the sprint or iteration. If the Actual Line is not on target, adjustments can be made, such as adding more resources or reducing the scope of the sprint.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improving Team Performance:    The Burn Down Chart serves as a feedback tool. It helps the team see their progress and the pace at which they are completing work. Over time, teams can use this data to improve their estimation skills, productivity, and sprint planning.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transparency and Communication:    Burn Down Charts promote transparency in Agile teams. It is a useful tool for stakeholders and team members alike, as it allows everyone to see the current state of the project. It improves communication and collaboration by providing a shared understanding of progress.</p> </li> <li> <p>Retrospective Discussions:    During sprint retrospectives, teams can review the Burn Down Chart to reflect on the sprint\u2019s progress and any issues encountered. The chart can help identify patterns in the team's workflow, such as whether tasks were under-estimated or external factors impeded progress.</p> </li> <li> <p>Handling Scope Changes:    If scope changes occur (e.g., new features are added or removed), the Burn Down Chart can be updated to reflect the new work remaining. This helps the team assess the impact of these changes on the sprint\u2019s timeline.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Benefits of Using a Burn Down Chart: - Simple and Visual: It provides a simple and quick visual reference to understand the project\u2019s progress. - Helps with Focus: The chart highlights how much work is left, helping the team focus on completing tasks and avoiding distractions. - Motivational: Seeing the line steadily go down as work is completed can serve as a motivational tool for the team. - Facilitates Agile Practices: It aligns well with Agile practices by encouraging incremental progress and continuous improvement.</p> <p>Limitations of Burn Down Charts: - Does Not Show Quality: While it tracks the amount of work remaining, it doesn\u2019t account for the quality of the work. A project could be \"burning down\" tasks quickly, but if the quality isn\u2019t high, this could be problematic in the long run. - May Lead to Oversimplification: It is easy to misinterpret the chart if it is not used correctly. For example, a flat or erratic Actual Line could be seen as a problem, but it may be due to external factors like dependencies or delays that are not captured in the chart. - Does Not Capture Dependencies or Blockers: The Burn Down Chart primarily tracks work completed but does not show blockers or dependencies between tasks, which could also impact progress.</p>"},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#_18","title":"\u7b2c\u4e09\u90e8\u5206","text":""},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#unit-test","title":"unit test","text":""},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#why-we-need-unit-test","title":"Why we need unit test","text":"<p>The value of unit testing can be summarized in the following four aspects:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Bring the Test as Early as Possible Unit testing encourages writing and running test cases early in the development process. The value of this approach lies in: - Early Detection of Defects: By writing unit tests early in the development phase, developers can validate functionality as they implement it, allowing defects to be detected early, thus reducing the cost of later fixes. - Improved Development Efficiency: With early feedback, developers can quickly identify issues, improving development efficiency and avoiding the complexity of debugging and fixing problems later in the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make the White Box Test Possible Unit testing facilitates white-box testing, which tests the internal logic of a program, particularly the details of code structure and implementation: - Transparency and Control: Unit testing allows developers to closely examine each part of the code, ensuring the correctness of the internal implementation. It helps to cover all code paths and test branches and conditions. - Validating Design and Implementation: It not only verifies that the functionality works as expected but also helps validate the design and ensures that the implementation aligns with the intended logic, thereby assisting developers in improving and optimizing the code structure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lower the Threshold of Test as Possible Unit testing lowers the barrier to testing, making it easier for developers to write and run tests: - Automation and Ease of Use: Unit tests are typically automated and can be executed easily, allowing developers to run tests and view results without requiring complex configurations or testing tools. This simplifies the testing process. - Encouraging Developer Participation: Because unit tests are automated and provide rapid feedback, developers are more likely to engage in testing, which increases the overall focus on quality control within the team.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make the Integration as Specific as Possible Unit testing helps achieve more specific and granular integration testing: - Early Verification of Integration Points: Through unit testing, developers can validate the functionality of individual modules before integrating them, ensuring that no new errors are introduced during integration. - Efficient Collaboration Between Modules: Unit testing ensures that each module is independently verified, ensuring that interfaces and interactions between modules are correct. This leads to smoother and more stable system integration.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"ZJU/SQAT.html#classic-pattern-of-unit-test","title":"Classic pattern of unit test","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Unit Testing in General Development In traditional development processes, unit tests are often written after the code has been developed. Developers typically write tests after implementing features or completing modules. Characteristics: - Timing of Writing Tests: Tests are written after code is implemented, typically once the feature or module is complete. - Test Coverage: Test cases are written to validate critical functionality that the developer deems necessary. It often involves validating whether the code works as expected. - Purpose of Testing: The primary goal is to find defects by verifying that the code behaves as expected and to catch bugs. - Separation of Testing and Development: Testing is a separate phase that comes after development, potentially leading to delays between development and testing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unit Testing in TDD (Test-Driven Development) In TDD, unit tests are an integral part of the development process. Developers write test cases before writing the code, starting with a failing test and then writing code to make it pass. Characteristics: - Timing of Writing Tests: Tests are written before the implementation code. Developers first write a failing test and then write code to make the test pass. - Test-Driven Development: The key principle is \"test first, code second.\" Testing is not an afterthought but a driving force in the development process. Each piece of functionality is developed around one or more tests. - Purpose of Testing: The goal is not only to validate functionality but to drive design. The tests help developers design clean and simple interfaces and architectures. - Rapid Feedback and Iteration: Since tests are written immediately after code, developers receive immediate feedback, enabling faster bug fixes and reducing defects. - High Test Coverage: TDD encourages incremental development, with each change accompanied by a new test. This typically leads to higher code test coverage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unit Testing in XP (Extreme Programming) XP emphasizes continuous integration, rapid feedback, simplicity, and collaboration. Unit testing is central to the development process in XP, and tests are written and executed continuously throughout the development cycle. Characteristics: - Timing of Writing Tests: Like TDD, unit tests are written continuously throughout development. Tests are often written before code and executed frequently. - Purpose of Testing: The goal of testing in XP is to ensure that each part of the system is working correctly and remains functional as the system evolves. Tests are used not only to find bugs but also to ensure high code quality in a collaborative environment. - Frequent Refactoring: XP encourages frequent refactoring of code. Unit tests provide a safety net, allowing developers to refactor without fear of breaking functionality. - Collective Code Ownership: In XP, anyone on the team can modify any part of the codebase. Unit tests ensure that changes do not introduce new defects, and they help maintain the stability of the code. - Continuous Integration and Automation: XP emphasizes the use of continuous integration and automated unit testing, ensuring that all features are always tested as they are integrated into the codebase.</p> </li>

She\u2019s a phenomenal table tennis player, and she\u2019s gained widespread recognition, especially after her impressive performance in the 2024 Paris Olympics. Sun Yingsha has become a household name in China, not just because of her exceptional skills, but also because of her dedication, sportsmanship, and relentless pursuit of excellence. At the Paris Olympics, Sun Yingsha had a remarkable run. She won several medals, among which the mixed doubles gold was particularly significant because it was the first-ever mixed doubles gold medal for the Chinese table tennis team.  What really impresses me about Sun Yingsha is her determination and focus on the game.(She\u2019s known for her incredible agility, quick reflexes, and powerful shots.) Watching her play is truly inspiring because she always gives it her all, whether it\u2019s a national competition or the Olympic finals. Despite being under immense pressure, she maintains a calm demeanor, which is something I really admire. Beyond her skills on the table, Sun Yingsha is also admired for her humility. Despite her numerous achievements, she remains grounded and always credits her teammates and coaches for her success. This attitude has won her a lot of fans, not just in China but around the world.  Her popularity in China goes beyond just sports enthusiasts. She has become a symbol of perseverance and excellence, especially for the younger generation. Many young athletes look up to her as a role model because she shows that with hard work, anything is possible.  All in all, Sun Yingsha is a true sports icon in China. I believe she will continue to inspire future generations with her incredible talent and unwavering dedication to the sport.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#_1","title":"\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u4eba","text":"<p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1a\u5468\u6df1</p> <p>exceptional vocal range and his ability to sing in various styles, ethereal, almost otherworldly quality</p> <p>his authenticity and his connection with fans: posts feature behind-the-scenes glimpses of his life, from rehearsals to casual moments in his life</p> <p>involved in charitable activities, on social media post ..</p> <p>a talented musician but also a positive and inspiring figure</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about Zhou Shen, a Chinese singer whom I follow on social media.

He shares his thoughts on music and life, and this personal touch makes him more relatable. I also admire how he interacts with his fans; for example, he often responds to comments and occasionally holds live-streaming sessions where he chats with his followers, which helps him build a closer relationship with his audience.</p> <p>Apart from his music, Zhou Shen is also quite involved in charitable activities, and he uses his platform to raise awareness about important social issues.

She's quite elderly, in her late seventies, but still very active and lively, which makes her stand out in the neighborhood. I first got to know her better when my family moved here, and we immediately became friends because of her warm and welcoming nature.</p> <p>Mrs. Li is an incredibly fascinating person. Despite her age, she\u2019s traveled to more than 40 countries and has a wealth of stories to share. She\u2019s a retired professional travel writer, and over the years, she\u2019s written a number of books and articles about her adventures, which is something I find really impressive. What\u2019s even more amazing is how humble she is about it. Unlike many people who might brag about such accomplishments, Mrs. Li is very down-to-earth. She\u2019s always willing to listen to others and seems genuinely interested in hearing about what\u2019s going on in my life, too.</p> <p>One of the things that really makes Mrs. Li stand out is her love of sharing her travel experiences. When we get the chance to chat, I can listen to her for hours. She\u2019s a fantastic storyteller, and I\u2019m always captivated by the way she describes the different cultures, people, and places she\u2019s visited. She\u2019s not only well-traveled but also very knowledgeable, so when she speaks about her experiences, I always feel like I\u2019m learning something new and valuable. I really admire her curiosity about the world and her open-minded approach to life.</p> <p>Interestingly, we also share a lot of common interests. We both love painting, especially watercolor, and we often spend time together working on our paintings. I think it\u2019s great to have a neighbor who has similar hobbies, as it makes it easier to connect and share ideas. Additionally, Mrs. Li is very into yoga, and though I\u2019m not as experienced as she is, she\u2019s always encouraging me to try new poses or attend local classes.</p> <p>What I truly appreciate about Mrs. Li, though, is how non-pretentious she is. It\u2019s rare to meet someone with so much life experience who remains so humble and unassuming. She never makes conversations about herself, which is refreshing because sometimes people who have done a lot in life can become a bit arrogant or self-centered. But Mrs. Li is always interested in what I have to say and makes me feel heard.</p> <p>In short, she\u2019s an inspiring, thoughtful, and kind person, and I feel really fortunate to have her as a neighbor. Our chats are something I look forward to, and I\u2019m always learning from her, whether it\u2019s about life, travel, or art.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#_3","title":"\u559c\u6b22\u4e00\u8d77\u804a\u5929\u7684\u670b\u53cb","text":"<p>\u7279\u70b9\uff1ahave known each other for, cherish the most in my life, go-to person</p> <p>\u539f\u56e0\uff1a</p> <ol> <li>an attentive listener \u548c\u73b0\u5728\u4eba\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0casks thoughtful questions and offers insightful advice</li> <li>share similar interests (books, movies, and current events)</li> <li>sense of humor, lightens the mood</li> </ol> <p>\u603b\u7ed3\uff1anot only enjoyable but also meaningful</p> Note <p>I'd like to talk about my friend Anna, who I absolutely love talking to. We\u2019ve known each other for about 3 years now, ever since we met in university, and over time, she\u2019s become one of the people I cherish the most in my life. Whenever I need someone to talk to, whether it\u2019s about something serious or just a lighthearted chat, Anna is always my go-to person. One of the main reasons I enjoy talking to her is because she\u2019s such an attentive listener. No matter what I\u2019m talking about, she always gives me her full attention, which is quite rare these days when people are often distracted by their phones. She doesn\u2019t just listen passively either\u2014she asks thoughtful questions and offers insightful advice. For example, there was a time when I was really struggling with making an academic decision, and she helped me weigh the pros and cons without being pushy or judgmental. Her ability to understand my perspective and give me advice that\u2019s actually helpful is something I truly appreciate. Another reason I love our conversations is because we share similar interests, especially when it comes to books, movies, and current events. We often end up having deep discussions about the latest book we\u2019ve read or a thought-provoking documentary we\u2019ve watched. These conversations can sometimes last for hours, but it never feels like a waste of time because I always come away feeling inspired or having learned something new. What I admire most about Anna is her sense of humor. Even when we\u2019re talking about serious topics, she has this amazing ability to make me laugh. It\u2019s not that she makes light of serious matters, but rather, she knows how to add a touch of humor that lightens the mood. This is especially comforting when I\u2019m feeling stressed or overwhelmed\u2014she just has a way of turning my day around with her jokes and witty comments. All in all, talking to Anna is something I genuinely look forward to because it\u2019s not only enjoyable but also meaningful. I always feel understood, supported, and uplifted after our conversations. It\u2019s a rare thing to have someone in your life with whom you can talk about almost anything, and I consider myself lucky to have a friend like her.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#_4","title":"\u559c\u6b22\u505a\u624b\u5de5\u7684\u4eba","text":"<p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1aAnna, creative &amp; crafty, have a knack for</p> <p>\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1apottery -- clay mugs and bowls, handmade cards, upcycle old stuff into something completely new</p> <p>\u4e3e\u4f8b \u9001\u793c\u7269\uff0cworn out boot into planter for succulents -- turn ordinary things into art</p> <p>\u611f\u53d7\uff1aaccomplishment, express herself, unwind -- admire </p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#_5","title":"\u60f3\u5171\u5ea6\u65f6\u5149\u7684\u4eba","text":"<p>I\u2019d like to talk about my friend Anna, who\u2019s someone I really enjoy spending time with.

She's not only a family member but also someone I deeply admire and look up to. My cousin has always been an incredibly organized and creative person, and over the years, I\u2019ve seen her develop these skills into something truly professional. Currently, she works as a graphic designer for a well-known agency, and I've always been fascinated by her work. The reason I would like to work with her is that we both share a passion for creative projects. I have some skills in building website and content creation, so I think we would complement each other quite well if we started a business together. For instance, I imagine we could run a small design and marketing firm, where she could handle the visual elements, while I focus on managing social media, and marketing strategies. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve casually discussed a few times, and I believe our combined skills would make for a solid partnership. Moreover, my cousin is someone who is extremely disciplined and has a strong work ethic, which I think would be a great influence on me. She's always been the kind of person who plans things meticulously, whether it\u2019s a project deadline or even a family event. This kind of structured approach to work is something I could definitely learn from. On the other hand, I\u2019m a bit more spontaneous and flexible, so I think we would balance each other out quite well. Another reason I\u2019d love to collaborate with her is that working with a family member, especially someone I\u2019m close to, would make the experience more enjoyable. I imagine it would create a sense of trust and openness, which can be hard to find when working with colleagues you don\u2019t know as well. Of course, there could be challenges, such as mixing family and business, but I think our strong communication skills would help us overcome any potential conflicts. In the future, if the opportunity arises, I would definitely love to start a creative venture with my cousin.

I told him to always start from finding the corner pieces\uff08\u56db\u89d2\u7684\u5757\u5757\uff09 and the edge pieces\uff08\u56db\u6761\u8fb9\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u5757\u5757\uff09.

Zhang is a Chinese educator and the founder of the Huaping High School for Girls, which was the first free high school exclusively for girls in China. Her dedication to education, especially for underprivileged girls in rural areas, is nothing short of extraordinary.</p> <p>Zhang Guimei has spent over two decades working tirelessly in the remote, mountainous regions of Yunnan province, where many families face economic difficulties. The area she chose to work in is incredibly impoverished, and girls there are often forced to drop out of school due to financial constraints or societal expectations. What\u2019s truly commendable about her work is that she not only focuses on providing free education but also personally visits families to persuade them to allow their daughters to attend school. In some cases, she even uses her own limited income to help pay for students' expenses.</p> <p>Her efforts have transformed countless lives. Many of her students, who would have otherwise been confined to a life of hardship, have gone on to pursue higher education and secure stable careers. Zhang's selflessness has not only empowered individual girls but also uplifted entire families and communities.</p> <p>What I find most inspiring about Zhang Guimei is her relentless commitment to social equality. Despite battling health issues, including cancer, she continues to devote her life to ensuring that girls from impoverished backgrounds have access to education. She firmly believes that education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, and her actions reflect that belief.</p> <p>In recognition of her contributions, she has received numerous national awards, including being named one of the \u201cPeople\u2019s Role Models\u201d in China. However, I think what truly sets her apart is her genuine compassion and her willingness to sacrifice her own well-being for the greater good.</p> <p>To sum up, Zhang Guimei is a true inspiration and a shining example of how one person\u2019s dedication and hard work can change society for the better. Her story reminds us that, with enough passion and determination, we can all make a positive difference in the world.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#stranger","title":"Stranger","text":""},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#_7","title":"\u4e00\u89c1\u8fd8\u60f3\u518d\u89c1\u7684\u4eba\uff08\u805a\u4f1a\u4e0a\u89c1\u5230\u7684\u4eba\uff09","text":"<p>\u6539\u7f16\u81ea a person met in a party</p> <p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1a </p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about a girl I met recently at my friend\u2019s dinner party. It was a gathering where I got the chance to meet a lot of new people, and this particular girl, who sat next to me, really stood out. We started talking almost immediately, and from the very first conversation, I could tell that we clicked. She was incredibly friendly, outgoing, and easy to talk to, and it felt like we were on the same wavelength. We just \u201cgot\u201d each other, and the conversation flowed effortlessly.</p> <p>What really intrigued me about her was that she was a professional traveler, and at the time, she had already traveled to over 40 different countries. She shared some of the most fascinating travel stories I\u2019d ever heard. I could tell she was a great storyteller because I was completely captivated by everything she said. Her stories weren\u2019t just about the places she visited; they were filled with details about the people she met, the cultures she experienced, and the unique moments that made each trip memorable. I was absolutely engaged throughout our conversation, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel inspired by her adventures.</p> <p>I really enjoyed talking to her because, first of all, I\u2019m someone who loves traveling too, so we had that in common. I found her experiences both exciting and educational. She was also incredibly knowledgeable about the world in general, not just travel. It was clear that she had a deep understanding of different cultures, global issues, and various ways of life. This made her very charismatic, as she didn\u2019t just talk about herself, but also shared insights and interesting facts about the world.</p> <p>What I appreciated the most about her, though, was how humble she was. Despite having traveled so much and experienced so many things, she didn\u2019t come across as pretentious or self-centered at all. It\u2019s common to meet people who have had extensive life experiences and for them to be a bit arrogant or always turn the conversation back to themselves. But she was the complete opposite. She was a great listener and was genuinely interested in what I had to say. I felt like she cared about my stories, too, and that made me admire her even more.</p> <p>Since we only met that once, I\u2019ve been really curious to get to know her better. I would love to hear more about her travels and learn from her perspectives on life, as she seemed so open-minded and wise. I also think she could teach me a lot about staying humble and grounded, despite achieving so much. So, I definitely hope to see her again and continue our conversation.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#items","title":"\u7269\u54c1 items","text":""},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#invention","title":"Invention","text":"<p>\u6709\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u660e useful invention</p> <p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1aonline payment\uff0ctransform</p> <p>\u4e3e\u4f8b\uff1aphysical, time-consuming \u2192 a few taps on phone</p> <p>\u597d\u5904\uff1aconvenience -- save time; secure; travel simple -- no hassle of currency exchange</p> Note <p>Today, I\u2019d like to talk about an invention that has become incredibly useful in my life: online payment systems. This technology has really transformed how I handle my finances and go about my daily activities. It includes various platforms like mobile banking apps, digital wallets, and payment systems like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and others. I first started using online payments a few years ago, and it\u2019s made my life so much easier and more efficient. In the past, whenever I needed to pay bills or make purchases, I had to visit physical stores or banks, which was time-consuming, especially with long queues. Now, I can pay for almost anything with just a few taps on my phone. Whether it's paying for groceries, ordering food delivery, or booking a taxi, I can do it instantly without needing cash or even a physical card. Also, these systems are highly secure, with encryption and two-factor authentication, so I don\u2019t worry much about fraud. Another thing I appreciate about online payments is how they make traveling simpler. I don\u2019t have to carry large amounts of cash when I\u2019m in a foreign country. I can just use my phone to pay for things, which is really helpful and reduces the hassle of currency exchange. Overall, I would say online payments have made my life more convenient, efficient, and secure. It\u2019s hard to imagine going back to the old days when I had to withdraw cash from ATMs or write checks. This invention has definitely become an indispensable part of my everyday life, and I believe it\u2019s something that more people will continue to rely on in the future.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#chinese-zither","title":"Chinese zither","text":"<p>a traditional item, musical instrument</p> <p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1aGu Zheng = Chinese zither, long history, a long, wooden instrument with typically 21 strings, played by plucking the strings using one\u2019s fingers, often with the help of finger picks made of plastic or even tortoiseshell</p> <p>I: bring me a sense of calm and relaxation.

This rule mandates that every student must meet a certain fitness standard in order to graduate, and I find it not only unreasonable but also counterproductive in some ways. First of all, the idea of having a unified fitness standard for all students is simply unrealistic. Every individual\u2019s health condition and fitness level are different, and this rule fails to take that into account. For example, I myself am not particularly good at physical activities due to issues with my respiratory system. During physical exercises, I often experience significant pain and discomfort, especially when I engage in endurance activities like running. This makes it extremely hard for me to meet the required fitness benchmarks. On the other hand, there are students who are naturally more athletic and enthusiastic about sports, and for them, this test might even feel like a fun challenge. The idea of applying the same standard to everyone is, in my opinion, unscientific and unfair. Furthermore, I believe that this physical fitness test erodes students' quality of life and freedom. University life should be about personal growth and exploration, but the pressure to meet an arbitrary fitness standard can lead to unnecessary stress. Instead of encouraging a healthy lifestyle, it often forces students into routines that may not be suitable for their individual needs. For students like me, who may have physical discomfort during strenuous activities, this rule can lead to feelings of inadequacy or even worsen their health problems. In the long run, it may also contribute to the development of negative attitudes towards fitness. The rule also seems outdated in today\u2019s world, where universities are increasingly focusing on personalized education and promoting mental well-being alongside physical health. Instead of imposing a one-size-fits-all fitness test, I believe universities should take a more individualized approach. For instance, students could be given a choice to take fitness assessments that align with their personal health conditions or interests, such as offering alternative activities like yoga, swimming, or even mental health workshops for those who struggle with physical challenges. In conclusion, I strongly feel that the fitness test rule in Chinese universities needs to be reformed or replaced with a more flexible and personalized approach that considers students\u2019 unique needs and capabilities. This would not only improve the students' physical and mental well-being but also allow them to focus more on their academic goals and overall development.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#cake","title":"Cake","text":"<p>\u60ca\u559c\u4e4b\u4e8b</p> <p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1abirthday cake from my boyfriend\uff0clong-distance relationship</p> <p>\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1abeautifully decorated cake\uff0chandcrafted and customized\uff0cnote\uff0c</p> <p>\u611f\u53d7\uff1aa surge of happiness and appreciation\uff0cone of the fondest memories </p> <p>One of the most surprising and happiest moments I've experienced was when I received a birthday cake from my boyfriend at the time.

My birthday was approaching, and honestly, I wasn\u2019t expecting much since we couldn't be together in person. I had planned to just spend the day quietly with a few close friends.

It wasn\u2019t just any store-bought cake\u2014it was handcrafted and customized with my favorite flavors and decorations. Apparently, he had coordinated with a local bakery near my school.

However, despite my best efforts, things didn\u2019t quite go as planned.</p> <p>To prepare for this, I spent a significant amount of time polishing my CV and writing tailored cover letters.

I even reached out to a few contacts and alumni for advice, but it still didn\u2019t work out.</p> <p>One of the challenges I encountered was the fact that many companies preferred candidates with prior experience, which created a sort of paradox: I needed experience to get the internship, but I needed the internship to gain experience. This was definitely frustrating and made me question my own abilities at times.</p> <p>Despite not achieving this goal, I\u2019ve tried to look at the situation positively. I realized that setbacks like these are part of the journey and can be valuable learning experiences. I\u2019ve learned to handle rejection better and have a clearer understanding of how competitive the job market can be.

I plan to start my search earlier next time, expand my network, and perhaps explore opportunities in smaller companies or startups where the competition might not be as fierce.

It was released by a Japanese artist named Pikotaro in 2016 and became an unexpected viral sensation. The song itself is quite simple, both in terms of its lyrics and its melody, but it's the quirky and absurd nature of it that makes it so interesting.</p> <p>The song\u2019s lyrics are ridiculously catchy and repetitive, consisting mostly of the words \"Pen,\" \"Pineapple,\" \"Apple,\" and \"Pen\" being paired together in a way that doesn\u2019t make any logical sense. For example, Pikotaro sings \"I have a pen, I have an apple, uh! Apple pen!\" It sounds almost childish, but that\u2019s what makes it so entertaining. The repetitive nature of the song, combined with its simple but energetic beat, creates a sense of fun and lightheartedness that\u2019s hard not to smile at when you hear it.</p> <p>What really grabbed people's attention, though, was the dance that goes along with the song. It\u2019s very simple, just a few hand gestures mimicking the action of holding a pen and an apple, but it became so iconic that people from all over the world started making their own versions of the dance, adding to its viral appeal. I think that\u2019s why it became such a huge hit globally, even though it\u2019s not a serious or traditional song. It has this kind of silly charm that makes it hard to forget.</p> <p>Despite the song\u2019s simplicity, I find it interesting because of how infectious it is. You can hear it just once, and it\u2019ll stay stuck in your head for hours, which is a sign of a very successful and memorable song. Even though it\u2019s not a song with deep lyrics or complex composition, its charm comes from how it plays with absurdity and humor, and how it reflects the way people in today\u2019s world are drawn to quirky, offbeat content.</p> <p>What I also find fascinating about PPAP is how it became a cultural phenomenon. The song was widely shared on social media and even appeared on various TV shows and in memes. It became a symbol of internet culture, and even though Pikotaro is a relatively unknown artist, he gained worldwide recognition because of it. So, for me, PPAP is a great example of how the Internet and social media can turn something unexpected into a global trend.</p> <p>In conclusion, I find PPAP interesting not just because of the catchy tune and the silly dance, but because it represents a unique moment in pop culture where something simple, quirky, and unexpected can capture the attention of millions and go viral. It\u2019s a fun song that always makes me smile whenever I hear it.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#class","title":"Class","text":"<p>\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b</p> <p>One course that left a lasting impression on me was actually a physical education class I took a while ago, rather than a traditional academic lesson. It was a team-building exercise that was both fun and incredibly insightful. The highlight of this class was a game called \"Tongxin Drum,\" which translates to \"United Drum.\" This activity was designed to enhance our teamwork and collaboration skills.</p> <p>The setup was quite simple yet challenging. We were divided into groups of eight, with each person positioned at a different point around a large, circular drum. The drum was suspended in the air by eight ropes, each held by one of us. In the middle of the drum, there was a ball, and our task was to move together in perfect coordination to bounce the ball continuously without letting it fall off. The goal was to see how many times we could bounce the ball in a row.</p> <p>What impressed me the most about this class was how it forced us to work together seamlessly. At first, it seemed like a straightforward task, but it turned out to be much more challenging than we expected. Each of us had to maintain just the right amount of tension on our ropes, and even the slightest movement by one person would affect the entire drum. We quickly realized that in order to succeed, we needed to communicate clearly and synchronize our movements. It was an excellent way to understand the importance of teamwork because if even one person was out of sync, the ball would fall off almost immediately.</p> <p>This course not only improved our physical coordination but also taught us valuable lessons about collaboration and trust. I remember feeling a great sense of accomplishment when we finally managed to keep the ball bouncing for more than 30 times in a row. It required patience, quick thinking, and a lot of encouragement from each other. The experience was both fun and rewarding, and it brought us closer as a group.</p> <p>What made this class particularly memorable was how it combined physical exercise with practical life skills. It was a refreshing break from the usual sports activities, and it showed me that even something as simple as moving in sync with others can teach us a lot about teamwork, trust, and communication. To this day, I remember that lesson whenever I\u2019m working in a group setting because it reminded me how crucial it is to listen, adapt, and support each other.</p> <p>Overall, the \"Tongxin Drum\" game during that PE class was a unique and impactful experience. It was not only a great workout but also a valuable lesson in how to collaborate effectively with others, making it one of the most impressive courses I\u2019ve ever attended.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#clothes","title":"Clothes","text":"<p>\u522b\u4eba\u7ed9\u4f60\u7684\u8863\u670d</p> <p>One item of clothing that I received as a gift and have cherished for years is a handmade sweater from my grandma. She gave it to me as a birthday present several years ago, and it holds a lot of sentimental value for me.</p> <p>The sweater is really special not just because it\u2019s a gift from my grandma, but also because she made it herself. My grandma has been knitting for as long as I can remember, and she\u2019s always crafted beautiful, intricate pieces for her family. When I opened the package and saw the sweater, I was immediately struck by the craftsmanship. It\u2019s made of soft wool, and the pattern is quite unique \u2013 a combination of subtle colors and geometric shapes that give it a cozy yet stylish look. The fit was perfect at the time, and it was incredibly comfortable to wear.</p> <p>What makes this sweater even more meaningful is the thought and time my grandma put into making it. She spent weeks working on it, knitting each section carefully, and I know that she poured a lot of love and attention into every stitch. Every time I wore it, I felt a deep connection to her and a sense of warmth, both physically and emotionally.</p> <p>However, now that I\u2019ve grown up, I\u2019ve outgrown the sweater. It no longer fits me as it once did, which is a bit bittersweet. Still, I can\u2019t bring myself to part with it because it holds so many memories. Even though I can\u2019t wear it anymore, I keep it tucked away in my wardrobe as a reminder of my grandma\u2019s affection and the special bond we share. Sometimes, when I\u2019m feeling nostalgic, I take it out just to feel close to her.</p> <p>Overall, this handmade sweater is one of the most meaningful gifts I\u2019ve ever received. It\u2019s not just about the sweater itself, but the love, effort, and thought behind it.

I can still remember how excited I was when I first got it, as I had always been fascinated by dragons ever since I was little. I think my love for dragons started from reading fairy tales and watching animated movies where these mythical creatures were portrayed as powerful and majestic beings. So, when I got the dragon doll, it felt like I finally had my own little piece of the fantasy world.</p> <p>The dragon doll itself was quite special. It was a vibrant green color, with golden wings that shimmered when the light hit them. The body was soft and plush, but the wings and tail had a slightly stiffer texture, which made them stand out. It also had bright, sparkling eyes that gave it a very lifelike appearance, almost as though it could come to life at any moment. I used to spend hours playing with it, imagining all sorts of adventures where my dragon would fly through the skies and protect me from imaginary villains\uff08\u574f\u4eba\uff09.</p> <p>What made this toy even more memorable for me was the sense of wonder and creativity it sparked. I didn\u2019t just play with it as a regular doll. I created entire worlds and stories around it, and it became a companion during many of my childhood games. It helped me develop my imagination and storytelling skills, as I would invent elaborate scenarios and scenarios involving my dragon. It also made me feel like I could escape into a fantasy realm whenever I wanted, which was something I really valued as a child.</p> <p>Though I\u2019ve grown up now and no longer play with the doll, I still keep it tucked away in a box as a reminder of my childhood and the magical adventures I had with it. It\u2019s not just a toy to me anymore; it\u2019s a symbol of the creativity and imagination that shaped a lot of my early years.

It\u2019s made from high-quality wood, and the pieces are laser-cut, which makes it very precise and easy to assemble.  The model actually has moving parts. Once completing the assembly,  we can see marbles, served as chocolate beans, roll through the structure, mimicking the process of chocolate being made in a factory. There are little gears and mechanisms that make the marbles move along a track, and when it\u2019s all put together, the factory comes to life in a fun and charming way.</p> <p>I think Anna would absolutely love this gift for several reasons. First, she enjoys working with her hands, so assembling this model would be a fun challenge for her. The fact that it\u2019s a chocolate factory theme would also appeal to her because she has a sweet tooth, and the idea of creating something that\u2019s related to chocolate is quite fitting. Secondly, I know that she appreciates gifts that are thoughtful and personalized, and this one would show that I understand her hobbies and interests.</p> <p>Moreover, this model would serve as both a relaxing activity and a decorative piece once it\u2019s completed. It\u2019s the kind of thing that she could proudly display on her shelf, and every time she looks at it, she\u2019d remember the fun process of building it.

I actually enjoy a cozy cottage look \uff08\u6e29\u99a8\u5ea6\u5047\u5c0f\u5c4b\u98ce\uff09, so I would want this house to have a cottage style to it. For me, the most important thing is what it features inside\uff08\u91cc\u9762\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u7279\u70b9\uff09.</p> <p>First, I love natural light, so I would want each room to be filled with sunlight. Each room needs to have big floor-to-ceiling windows\uff08\u843d\u5730\u7a97\uff09to let the sun get in. And then, since I\u2019m a foodie\uff08\u5403\u8d27\uff09 and love cooking, I would like to have an open-concept kitchen\uff08\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u53a8\u623f\uff09, it would be a little bit vintage style\uff08\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u5c0f\u590d\u53e4\u98ce\uff09, and there would be a big island\uff08\u5c9b\u53f0\uff09 in the middle, with a beautiful marble countertop\uff08\u5927\u7406\u77f3\u53f0\u9762\uff09. It would be a place where all my family members could cook and enjoy nice food together.</p> <p>Oh, another thing\uff08\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u513f\uff09I wish I could\uff08\u6211\u5f88\u5e0c\u671b\uff09 have is a home library\uff08\u5bb6\u5ead\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\uff09 where I can put tons of books on the bookshelves, you know, just like those you see in the movies. I might not read all of them, but they look pretty cool. I would have a reading corner/nook in the room with a beautiful yellow fabric armchair and a reading lamp. I would spend a lot of time snuggling up\uff08\u8737\u7f29\uff09 with a good book in that chair, reading and enjoying my time alone.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, I would love to have a big yard where I could grow some plants and flowers, and the whole backyard would be filled with a sweet scent/fragrance\uff08\u82b3\u9999\uff09 of different flowers in springtime.</p> <p>So yeh, I would love to live in a nice place like what I\u2019ve just described. It would be in a great location and everything would be designed to my liking\uff08\u6309\u7167\u6211\u7684\u559c\u597d\uff09. It would be my sanctuary/ my retreat\uff08\u6211\u7684\u5185\u5fc3\u7597\u517b\u57fa\u5730\uff09where I could enjoy the tranquility in life and quality time with my family. </p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#city","title":"City","text":"<p>Today, I\u2019d like to talk about an interesting city worth visiting \u2014 Shanghai. It is located on the eastern coast of China. Shanghai is not only one of the largest cities in the world but also one of the most vibrant and diverse. It seamlessly blends traditional Chinese culture with modern, cutting-edge development, making it a truly fascinating place to explore.</p> <p>One of the things that immediately struck me about Shanghai is its iconic skyline, especially the area known as the Bund. On one side, you have historic colonial-era buildings, and on the other, the futuristic skyscrapers of Pudong, like the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Shanghai Tower, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world. At night, the cityscape lights up with colorful displays, creating a breathtaking view.</p> <p>What I find most interesting about Shanghai is its unique blend of old and new. For instance, you can visit the ancient Yu Garden, which dates back to the Ming Dynasty, and within minutes, you can find yourself in the bustling, high-tech shopping district of Nanjing Road. It\u2019s a city where tradition and modernity coexist harmoniously, offering a rich cultural experience.</p> <p>Another thing I absolutely love about Shanghai is its diverse food scene. Whether you\u2019re sampling street food like the famous xiaolongbao, which are juicy soup dumplings, or dining at upscale restaurants, there\u2019s something for every palate. The city is also known for its vibrant nightlife, with trendy bars and rooftop lounges that offer stunning views of the cityscape.</p> <p>Beyond its sights and cuisine, what makes Shanghai truly captivating is its dynamic energy. The city never seems to sleep, and there\u2019s always something happening, whether it\u2019s a cultural festival, an art exhibition, or a live music performance. It\u2019s a place that attracts people from all over the world, making it a melting pot of different cultures and ideas.</p> <p>Personally, I find Shanghai inspiring because it\u2019s constantly evolving while still preserving its rich cultural heritage. It\u2019s a city that reflects China\u2019s rapid modernization but also honors its past. It\u2019s a place that leaves a lasting impression and makes you want to return again and again. For anyone looking to experience the best of what a modern metropolis can offer, Shanghai is definitely a must-visit destination.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#experiences","title":"\u7ecf\u5386 Experiences","text":""},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#important-things","title":"Important things","text":"<p>\u7528\u624b\u673a\u505a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5</p> <p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1aan offline academic lecture\uff0cran out of battery</p> <p>\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1asalvage the situation, jot down key points, </p> <p>\u611f\u53d7\uff1arelief,  </p> <p>I'd like to talk about a time when I used my smartphone to do something really important. This happened just a few months ago during a offline academic lecture. It was an important session for one of my courses, and I was relying on my laptop to take notes. But, unfortunately, halfway through the lecture, my laptop suddenly ran out of battery. I hadn\u2019t realized it was so low, and I didn\u2019t have my charger with me at that moment.</p> <p>At first, I panicked because I didn\u2019t want to miss any critical information from the lecture. It was a session led by a guest lecturer, so I knew it wasn\u2019t something that would be easily repeated. That\u2019s when I decided to use my smartphone to salvage the situation. I quickly took out my phone, using the notes app to jot down key points.</p> <p>What really surprised me was how effective my phone turned out to be for taking notes. Of course, the screen was much smaller than my laptop\u2019s, but the phone\u2019s keyboard was responsive, and I was able to type relatively quickly. I even found it convenient to use voice typing for some parts, which allowed me to capture information even faster. Additionally, I could switch between apps seamlessly to check references and details the lecturer mentioned during the talk.</p> <p>In the end, I managed to take detailed notes without missing much of the lecture, which was a huge relief. I was actually proud of myself for staying calm and adapting to the situation. I realized that my phone is more than just a device for communication or entertainment; it\u2019s a powerful tool that can be incredibly useful in unexpected situations.</p> <p>After that experience, I made it a habit to keep my phone fully charged during important events, and I\u2019ve even started using it more often for taking notes or accessing online resources when I\u2019m on the go. It was a lesson in being resourceful and making the most of what I had at the moment. It might have been a small incident, but it definitely left a lasting impression on how versatile smartphones can be for academic purposes.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#eating","title":"Eating","text":""},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#_8","title":"\u548c\u670b\u53cb\u53bb\u8fc7\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u5730\u65b9","text":"<p>\uff08\u548c\u670b\u53cb\u5403\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u83dc\uff09\uff1b\u522b\u4eba\u505a\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u4e00\u9910\uff1b\u5608\u6742\u4e4b\u5730\uff1b\u5468\u56f4\u4eba\u5236\u9020\u566a\u97f3</p> <p>\u9910\u5385\u7279\u5f81\uff1aMexican place, newly opened, had never been to, don't know what to expect</p> <p>\u5403\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1atacos, burritos, fajita -- unusual -- tortillas \u5bf9\u6bd4 rice -- surprising delicious, mouth-watering</p> <p>\u611f\u53d7\uff1afilling -- stomach was about to explode, music &amp; atmosphere -- pretty unique</p> <p>So, off the top of my head\uff08\u9996\u5148\u60f3\u5230\u7684\uff09, I remember I went to a Mexican place\uff08\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u9910\u9986\uff09 for the first time several years ago, and it was a pretty special experience for me.</p> <p>I went there with two friends.

Anyway\uff08\u5207\u6362\u8bdd\u9898\u5185\u5bb9\uff09, in terms of when and where I had it, well, it was about 3 years ago, in Beijing. I went to this little hole-in-the-wall\uff08\u4f4e\u8c03\u5c0f\u9986\uff09/ private kitchen\uff08\u79c1\u4eba\u53a8\u623f\uff09 with my friend. It was a dinner for 15 strangers.

On one hand, she told me he was funny, charming, and could always make her laugh. She appreciated his sense of humor and charisma, which had initially drawn her to him.

She feels much lighter and happier without the constant stress he brought into her life. While it wasn\u2019t easy for her to go through, she now realizes it was the right thing to do.

This was not only wasteful but also pretty annoying, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. At first, I thought about asking my parents to call a plumber, but then I figured it would be a good learning experience to try and fix it myself.</p> <p>The first thing I did was watch a couple of tutorial videos online to understand the basics of how a tap works and what might be causing the issue. After some research, I realized that the problem was most likely a worn-out washer inside the tap. Luckily, we had a set of basic tools and some spare washers at home.</p> <p>I turned off the water supply and carefully unscrewed the tap handle. I was a bit nervous at first, worried that I might make the problem worse, but I managed to remove the faulty washer and replace it with a new one. Once I put everything back together and turned on the water supply again, I was thrilled to see that the leak had stopped!</p> <p>Honestly, fixing the tap gave me a real sense of accomplishment. It wasn\u2019t just about saving the cost of hiring a professional, but also about gaining the confidence to handle small repairs around the house. Plus, it felt good to be able to contribute to maintaining our home, especially since I\u2019m usually not very handy with tools.</p> <p>In conclusion, what started as a minor household inconvenience turned into a valuable learning experience. It made me realize that with the right resources and a bit of patience, even a teenager like me can handle simple repairs.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#study-method","title":"Study method","text":""},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#something-helps-you-concentrate-on-study","title":"\u63d0\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b something helps you concentrate on study","text":"<p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1aPomodoro Technique, 25-minute intervals</p> <p>without breaks, wander -- manageable, rechange mentally</p> <ol> <li>high level of focus, feeling burnt out</li> <li>motivated </li> </ol> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about a technique that has really helped me stay focused during my studies, and that\u2019s using the Pomodoro Technique. It might sound simple, but it has had a huge impact on my productivity. Essentially, this method involves breaking down my study time into 25-minute intervals, known as 'Pomodoros', followed by a short 5-minute break. After four cycles, I take a longer break, usually around 15 to 20 minutes.</p> <p>I discovered this technique a couple of years ago when I was struggling to stay concentrated while preparing for a major exam. I noticed that whenever I tried to study for long hours without breaks, my mind would start wandering, and I would become easily distracted. However, once I started using the Pomodoro Technique, it was like a game-changer for me. Knowing that I only have to focus for 25 minutes at a time makes the task seem more manageable, and the short breaks help me recharge mentally.</p> <p>What I find particularly effective about this method is that it helps me maintain a high level of focus during those short bursts of time. I often turn off my phone and eliminate any distractions during each session. Surprisingly, I can accomplish much more in those concentrated intervals than when I try to study for hours on end without a clear structure. The breaks also prevent me from feeling burnt out, allowing me to sustain my energy levels throughout the day.</p> <p>Besides, the Pomodoro Technique helps me stay motivated because it adds a sense of urgency. I try to challenge myself to complete a specific task before the timer runs out, which keeps me engaged. Additionally, after a few cycles, I reward myself with something small, like a cup of coffee or some snacks, which helps me stay refreshed and ready to continue.</p> <p>In conclusion, this simple yet effective technique has greatly improved my ability to concentrate and manage my time efficiently. It\u2019s definitely something I would recommend to anyone struggling to stay focused, whether it\u2019s for studying or even working on other projects.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#a-waychange-that-helps-you-save-a-lot-of-time","title":"\u8282\u7ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5 a way/change that helps you save a lot of time","text":"<p>Introduction (General introduction of the topic)</p> <ul> <li>Briefly mention what you're going to talk about.</li> <li>\"I'd like to talk about a time-management method called the Pomodoro Technique that has really helped me save a lot of time and work more efficiently.\"</li> </ul> <p>Describe the technique (Explain how it works)</p> <ul> <li>Introduce the Pomodoro Technique.</li> <li>\"The Pomodoro Technique involves working in short bursts of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break.

It breaks down the work into manageable chunks, so I never feel overwhelmed, and the short breaks allow me to recharge before diving back into the task.</p> <p>One of the major advantages is that it helps me stay highly focused. Knowing that I only need to work for a short, set period means that I\u2019m less likely to get distracted or lose motivation. I find that I\u2019m able to maintain a higher level of concentration compared to when I try to work for several hours straight. Over time, I've found that I\u2019m able to complete tasks much faster, without compromising the quality of my work.</p> <p>In addition, the Pomodoro Technique also encourages me to be more mindful about how I use my time. Because I have these short breaks, I\u2019ve become more conscious of my productivity patterns and can adjust my workflow if I feel I\u2019m not being as efficient as I could be. Overall, adopting the Pomodoro Technique has saved me a lot of time by helping me work more effectively, stay organized, and reduce burnout.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#countryside","title":"Countryside","text":"<p>\u53bb\u8fc7\u7684\u4e61\u6751</p> <p>\u5b89\u9759\u7684\u5730\u65b9</p> <p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1aSt. Petersburg\uff0cPavlovsk </p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about a trip I once took to the countryside outside of St. Petersburg, Russia. It was during the summer a few years ago when I had the opportunity to visit this serene and picturesque area. </p> <p>The place I visited was a small village called Pavlovsk. It\u2019s famous for its stunning imperial park and palace, which were once the summer residence of the Russian Tsars. The village itself had an old-world charm, with quaint wooden houses, gardens bursting with colorful flowers, and narrow, winding roads. It was such a refreshing change from the busy and bustling city life of St. Petersburg.</p> <p>What struck me most about the countryside there was how peaceful and quiet it was. As I walked along the park\u2019s shaded paths, I could hear nothing but the rustle of leaves and birds chirping. The air was incredibly fresh, and the scent of pine trees and wildflowers was everywhere. A lake in the park is surrounded by tall birch trees reflected in the calm, mirror-like water. It felt like I was stepping back in time to a simpler, more relaxed era.</p> <p>I also had the chance to interact with some of the locals, who were warm and welcoming. They even invited me to try some traditional Russian dishes, like blini and borscht, made from fresh ingredients grown in their gardens. This experience made the trip even more memorable because it gave me a glimpse into their way of life, which is so deeply connected to nature.</p> <p>Overall, visiting the countryside near St. Petersburg was a truly unforgettable experience. It gave me a much-needed break from the city\u2019s fast-paced environment and allowed me to immerse myself in the natural beauty and history of the area. I would love to go back one day, especially in autumn when the leaves change color, as I imagine it would be even more breathtaking.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#traffic-jam","title":"Traffic jam","text":"<p>I\u2019d like to talk about a time when I was stuck in a traffic jam, but it wasn\u2019t the typical car traffic you might imagine. This happened on my university campus, and it involved bikes rather than cars. Since I'm a student, I commute to different classes on my electric bike every day because our campus is quite large. There\u2019s a long break between classes, and during this time, many students, including myself, need to move between buildings. Unfortunately, this often leads to a chaotic situation.</p> <p>The main issue is that there\u2019s only one main road connecting the east and west sides of the campus, and it's the shortest route. Taking any other path would be three times longer, so naturally, everyone prefers using this route. One day, I had a class in a building on the west side, and I had just finished a class in the east. The teacher delayed the class for 5 minutes, so as soon as the class was over, I jumped on my bike and headed towards the other building.</p> <p>However, as soon as I reached the main road, I found myself stuck in a bike traffic jam. There were dozens, if not hundreds, of students on electric bikes, all trying to use the same road at the same time. The university guard was trying to manage the flow, but many students were impatient and didn\u2019t listen to his instructions. This only made the situation worse, as everyone was trying to squeeze through, making the road even more congested.</p> <p>I was frustrated because I knew I was running late. At one point, we were all at a standstill, unable to move forward or backward. When the traffic finally started moving again, I still had to struggle to find a parking spot near my class building. Most of the parking spaces were already full, so I ended up circling around, wasting even more time. In the end, I arrived five minutes late for my class, which was quite embarrassing.</p> <p>Looking back, it was a stressful experience, but it also taught me to plan my commute better during those peak times. Now, if I know I have back-to-back classes in different buildings, I try to leave a bit earlier to avoid getting stuck in that bike traffic jam. It\u2019s definitely one of those unique challenges of being a student on a large campus.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#advice-about-study","title":"Advice about study","text":"<p>\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u5efa\u8bae</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about a time when I received some very helpful advice regarding my studies during high school. Back then, I was under a lot of pressure to perform well academically, and I often found myself feeling overwhelmed and distracted whenever I tried to study. So, I decided to visit the school\u2019s counseling office to seek some guidance.</p> <p>When I explained my situation to the counselor, I told her that my biggest struggle was maintaining concentration. I would often start studying with good intentions, but within minutes, my mind would wander off, and I\u2019d end up procrastinating or getting distracted by my phone. That\u2019s when she suggested a technique called the Pomodoro Technique, which was something I had never heard of before.</p> <p>The Pomodoro Technique involves breaking your study time into 25-minute intervals, called \"pomodoros,\" followed by a short 5-minute break. After completing four of these intervals, you can take a longer break of about 15 to 30 minutes. The counselor explained that this method helps improve focus and productivity by giving the brain regular breaks, which prevents burnout and keeps you refreshed. She advised me to try it out, especially since I was struggling with staying on task for long periods.</p> <p>I decided to follow her advice, and to my surprise, it made a significant difference. I started using a timer on my phone to break my study sessions into 25-minute chunks, and I noticed that my concentration improved dramatically. Knowing that a break was coming made it easier to stay focused during each interval. I also felt less stressed because instead of trying to force myself to study for hours on end, I was working in manageable bursts. It made my study sessions much more efficient and even enjoyable.</p> <p>What I appreciated most about this advice was that it was practical and easy to implement, yet it had a profound impact on my productivity. This simple technique helped me manage my study stress better and made a noticeable difference in my performance. To this day, I still use the Pomodoro Technique whenever I need to focus on a challenging task, and I\u2019m grateful to that counselor for introducing me to it.</p> <p>Overall, this experience taught me that sometimes, the right advice can completely change the way you approach your studies. The Pomodoro Technique was a game-changer for me, and it\u2019s something that continues to benefit me even now.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#busy-time","title":"Busy time","text":"<p>\u4e00\u6b21\u975e\u5e38\u5fd9\u788c\u7684\u7ecf\u5386</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about a time when I was extremely busy, which happened during the exams week in college last semester. It was one of the most stressful periods I\u2019ve ever experienced because I had to prepare for nine exams, and I only had a week to do it. To be honest, I got myself into that situation because I had procrastinated on my review schedule and left everything until the last minute.</p> <p>At the start of that week, I realized how much I needed to catch up on. Each subject required intensive preparation, and the topics were quite challenging. I was overwhelmed, but there was no time to waste, so I quickly created a strict study plan. I divided my time into blocks, dedicating several hours each day to each subject, and even sacrificed sleep to make more time for studying. There were days when I was up until 3 or 4 in the morning, only to wake up a few hours later and continue revising.</p> <p>To make things even more stressful, all the exams were back-to-back with no breaks in between. I remember one particular day when I had two exams, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. As soon as I finished the first exam, I rushed to the library to cram for the next one. I had to juggle multiple textbooks, class notes, and online resources, trying to digest as much information as possible in a short time.</p> <p>What made it even more difficult was that each subject required a different approach. For subjects like mathematics and physics, I had to focus on solving practice problems, while for literature and politics, I had to memorize facts and analyze texts. I was mentally exhausted, but I kept pushing through because I knew I didn\u2019t have any other option.</p> <p>In the end, it was an exhausting week, but it paid off. I managed to get through all nine exams, and although I didn\u2019t get perfect scores, I was able to pass them all with decent grades. The experience taught me a valuable lesson about time management and the importance of starting my preparation early. I realized that the stress and sleepless nights could have been avoided if I had been more disciplined with my study schedule from the beginning.</p> <p>Looking back, it was definitely one of the busiest and most intense weeks of my college life. But it also showed me that when pushed to the limit, I\u2019m capable of focusing and working hard under pressure. Now, I always try to plan ahead to avoid getting into such stressful situations again.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#competitionreward","title":"Competition/Reward","text":""},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#_11","title":"\u60f3\u53c2\u52a0\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b","text":"<p>\u60f3\u53c2\u52a0\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\uff1abicycle slow-riding contest</p> <p>Introduction</p> <ul> <li>Briefly introduce the competition you would like to participate in.</li> <li>\"I would like to talk about a bicycle slow-riding competition that takes place at my school.\"</li> </ul> <p>Describe the competition</p> <ul> <li>Explain how the competition works.</li> <li>\"In this contest, participants have to ride a bicycle as slowly as possible without losing balance or touching the ground.\"</li> </ul> <p>When and why you first learned about it</p> <ul> <li>Mention when you first heard about it or saw someone participate.</li> <li>\"I first became interested in this competition when my roommate participated last year and won first place.\"</li> </ul> <p>Why you want to participate</p> <ul> <li>Explain why this competition attracts you or why you think you\u2019d do well.</li> <li>\"I\u2019ve always been good at balancing on a bike, and I believe I can do well in this competition because I have the skills to maintain control at slow speeds.\"</li> </ul> <p>Benefits of participating</p> <ul> <li>Discuss what you hope to gain from participating.</li> <li>\"I think it would be a fun challenge, and it would help me improve my focus and patience.

I was really impressed by how skillfully she managed to maintain her balance while riding at such a slow pace, and it inspired me to give it a try myself.</p> <p>What makes this competition so intriguing to me is that it\u2019s not about speed or endurance, but rather about balance, control, and patience.

This happened a few months ago when my friends and I decided to have a picnic at a nearby park. We were all feeling a bit overwhelmed with our studies and assignments, so we thought it would be a great idea to take a break and relax outdoors. Since we were all on a tight budget, we wanted to do something fun without spending much money.</p> <p>We planned it quite simply. Each of us brought some homemade food, like sandwiches, fruit, and snacks. I took a batch of cookies from ingredients I already had at home, so it didn\u2019t cost me anything extra. One of my friends brought a bottle of homemade iced tea, while another brought some fruits that were already in season. It was a perfect potluck-style picnic where everyone contributed something small.</p> <p>On the day of the picnic, we headed to a large park near our university. The weather was perfect\u2014it was sunny but not too hot, with a gentle breeze that made it really pleasant to sit outside.

It felt so refreshing to be away from the usual hustle and bustle of daily life.</p> <p>What made the day even more special was that we brought along some games. One of my friends brought a deck of cards, and we ended up playing card games. It was so much fun, and we were all laughing so hard that we completely lost track of time. At one point, we even took a short walk around the park, enjoying the beautiful scenery and the blooming flowers.</p> <p>The best part about that day was that it didn\u2019t cost us much at all.

I started this habit around a year ago when I realized I needed to improve my fitness level but didn't have the motivation to go to a gym or fitness class. The convenience of exercising at home with the guidance of a live streamer was a game-changer for me.</p> <p>The streamer I follow specializes in HIIT workouts, which stand for High-Intensity Interval Training. These sessions typically last about 30 to 45 minutes and combine cardio exercises with strength training, which helps me not only burn calories but also build muscle. What I find particularly motivating is that the streamer often interacts with viewers, offering words of encouragement and answering questions in real-time. This interactive aspect makes the experience much more engaging than simply following a pre-recorded video.</p> <p>One of the main reasons I enjoy exercising this way is that it fits easily into my schedule. I can join the live stream whenever it's convenient for me, and if I miss a session, I can always watch the recording later. Plus, the variety of workouts keeps things interesting. The streamer mixes things up by incorporating different types of exercises, like yoga stretches or core workouts, so it never feels monotonous.</p> <p>I've noticed significant benefits since I started these workouts. I\u2019ve become more energetic, and my endurance has improved considerably. Additionally, it's been great for my mental health, especially when I\u2019ve had a long, stressful day. Following along with someone who's both knowledgeable and enthusiastic really helps me stay consistent and motivated.</p> <p>In the future, I\u2019d like to explore other fitness routines, but for now, following this online streamer is definitely my favorite way to stay fit. It\u2019s practical, effective, and, most importantly, enjoyable.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#celebrating-event","title":"Celebrating event","text":"<p>\u5e86\u795d\u8fc7\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8</p> <p>One of the most memorable events I celebrated recently was New Year\u2019s Eve on December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2023, which coincided with an annual celebration called Student's Day on our university campus. This event is something I look forward to every year because it\u2019s a unique combination of welcoming the new year and celebrating the vibrancy of student life.</p> <p>The celebration is truly a full-day affair, packed with a variety of activities. The day began with a student parade in the morning. It was incredible to watch the students marching in colorful costumes, holding banners, and showcasing different performances representing various clubs and departments. The parade had a lively and festive atmosphere, and you could feel the energy and excitement in the air. Everyone was cheering, taking photos, and soaking in the festive spirit.</p> <p>In the afternoon, the campus was bustling with small games and competitions organized by different student organizations. I participated in a few games with my friends, like tug-of-war and a trivia quiz, which was a lot of fun. These activities brought everyone together, and it was a great way to bond with classmates and even make new friends. I especially enjoyed the friendly, competitive spirit that filled the air.</p> <p>However, the highlight of the day was definitely the party performances held on the playground in the evening. As night fell, the entire campus was lit up with fairy lights and decorations, creating a magical ambiance. There were performances by student bands, dance groups, and even some comedy sketches, which had everyone laughing and clapping. Additionally, there was a campfire activity where all the students gathered around the flames, dancing and enjoying each other's company under the night sky</p> <p>What made this event so special was not just the celebration itself but also the feeling of togetherness. It was the perfect way to wrap up the year and welcome a new one surrounded by friends, laughter, and a sense of community. I felt genuinely happy and grateful to be a part of such a lively and positive environment.</p> <p>This celebration will always hold a special place in my heart because it reminded me of the joy of being in college, surrounded by people who are not just classmates but a second family. It was a day full of fun, excitement, and unforgettable memories.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#organizing-event","title":"Organizing event","text":"<p>\u6210\u529f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e00\u573a\u6d3b\u52a8</p> <p>One event that I organized successfully was an icebreaker activity for a student society that I\u2019m part of. This took place last semester when our society was welcoming new members, and we wanted to create a warm and friendly atmosphere where everyone could get to know each other better.</p> <p>The idea of organizing this event came to me because I noticed that new members often felt a bit shy and hesitant to interact with others during our meetings. Since I was in charge of member engagement, I decided to hold an icebreaker activity to help everyone feel more comfortable and connected.</p> <p>To organize the event, I first spent some time researching fun and engaging icebreaker games that would be suitable for a group of around 30 people. I eventually settled on a mix of activities, such as \"Two Truths and a Lie\" and a team-based scavenger hunt. These games were interactive, easy to participate in, and didn\u2019t require any special equipment, which made it practical given our limited resources.</p> <p>Next, I planned out the logistics. I reserved a spacious room on campus, made sure we had all the necessary materials like notepads and small prizes for the winners and even arranged for some snacks and refreshments. I also created a schedule to ensure that everything ran smoothly, starting with a quick introduction, followed by the games, and ending with some free time for everyone to chat.</p> <p>On the day of the event, I was a bit nervous about whether everything would go as planned. However, to my relief, the activities turned out to be a huge success. The new members were initially a bit reserved, but once the games began, everyone started laughing, interacting, and forming new friendships. The \"Two Truths and a Lie\" game was particularly effective because it encouraged people to share interesting facts about themselves, which led to some lively discussions.</p> <p>The feedback I received afterward was overwhelmingly positive. Many members told me that the icebreaker activities helped them feel more at ease and excited to participate in future societal events. This made me feel incredibly proud because I had achieved my goal of fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.</p> <p>In hindsight\uff08\u4e8b\u540e\u56de\u60f3\uff09, organizing this event taught me a lot about planning and time management. It also boosted my confidence in my organizational skills, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment knowing that I had brought people together and helped create a sense of community. It\u2019s definitely an experience I would love to repeat, and I\u2019m already thinking of ways to make the next event even more engaging.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#skill-learned-from-a-senior","title":"Skill learned from a senior","text":"<p>\u5411\u957f\u8005\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u80fd</p> <p>One skill that I learned from an older person is how to make rice dumplings, which I learned from my grandmother. In my culture, rice dumplings, or \"zongzi\" as we call them, are traditionally made to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, and it's a skill that's been passed down through generations.</p> <p>I first learned this skill a few years ago when I visited my grandmother during one of my school holidays. Growing up, I had always been fascinated by how she would so effortlessly wrap the dumplings with bamboo leaves, filling them with sticky rice, red beans, and pieces of marinated meat. So, one day, I asked her to teach me how to make them, and she was more than happy to pass on her knowledge.</p> <p>The process was much more challenging than I had anticipated. First, my grandmother showed me how to soak the sticky rice overnight\uff08\u5c06\u7cef\u7c73\u6d78\u6ce1\u4e00\u591c\uff09 and prepare the fillings, making sure they were well-seasoned\uff08\u628a\u9985\u6599\u8c03\u5473\u597d\uff09. The most difficult part, though, was folding the bamboo leaves into a neat triangular shape and securing them with string. My initial attempts were clumsy; the leaves would slip, and the filling would spill out. However, my grandmother was very patient. She guided me step by step, demonstrating how to fold the leaves tightly and tie the string so that the dumplings wouldn\u2019t fall apart during boiling.</p> <p>What I really appreciated about learning this skill from my grandmother was not just mastering the technique but also hearing the stories and traditions behind it. She shared how her mother taught her, and how, back in the day, families would gather to make these dumplings together, turning it into a cherished tradition. It made me realize that making rice dumplings isn\u2019t just about the food itself, but also about family bonding and preserving cultural heritage.</p> <p>Since learning this skill, I\u2019ve tried making rice dumplings on my own a few times, especially during the Dragon Boat Festival, to share with friends and family. Although I\u2019m not nearly as skilled as my grandmother, I\u2019ve definitely improved. What makes me happiest is seeing the smiles on people\u2019s faces when they taste the dumplings I've made\u2014it\u2019s a small way for me to keep our family tradition alive.</p> <p>Looking back, I\u2019m grateful for the time I spent with my grandmother learning this skill. It\u2019s not just a practical cooking technique but also a connection to my roots and a way to honor the past. I hope to continue making rice dumplings and maybe one day pass on this skill to younger members of my family.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#show-something-new-to-young","title":"Show something new to young","text":"<p>\u5411\u5c0f\u8f88\u5c55\u793a\u65b0\u4e1c\u897f</p> <p>One memorable experience when I showed something new to someone younger than me was introducing my younger cousin to the basics of coding. This happened last summer when he visited me for a week during his school break. At that time, I had already been studying computer science in college, and my cousin, who is about 14 years old, had shown an interest in technology but had never tried coding before.</p> <p>I decided to introduce him to Python, as it\u2019s one of the easiest programming languages for beginners. I could see that he was really curious, so I thought it would be a great opportunity to share something useful and fun with him. To make it engaging, I planned a few simple projects that I thought he would enjoy, such as creating a basic quiz game and a simple program to draw shapes using Python\u2019s turtle module.</p> <p>At first, he was a bit overwhelmed by the syntax and commands, but I made sure to break everything down into simple steps. I explained how each line of code worked and encouraged him to try writing it himself. What really surprised me was how quickly he caught on. Within an hour, he was already experimenting with changing the code to customize the quiz questions and add new shapes to the drawing program. Seeing his excitement and creativity was incredibly rewarding for me.</p> <p>Throughout the process, I tried to encourage him by emphasizing that making mistakes was a natural part of learning. I shared stories about how I had also struggled with coding when I first started and how perseverance was key. He seemed to appreciate hearing about my experiences, which made him more confident and willing to experiment on his own.</p> <p>This experience taught me that sharing knowledge can be incredibly rewarding. It\u2019s not just about teaching someone a new skill, but also about inspiring them and nurturing their curiosity. I was really happy to see that I had made a positive impact on my cousin, and I realized that I enjoyed mentoring others.

We never really had a chance to interact much. </p> <p>After we graduated from primary school, we ended up going to different middle schools, and naturally, we just lost touch\uff08\u5931\u8054\uff09. Back then, there wasn\u2019t social media, and we didn\u2019t even have our own phones, so we never exchanged contact information\uff08\u4ea4\u6362\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u5f0f\uff09 or stayed in touch\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u8054\u7cfb\uff09.

It was a spontaneous conversation we had one afternoon while we were walking around the playground, just enjoying the fresh air and chatting. The topic of our discussion was \u201cpredicting the future\u201d, which might sound a bit strange, but at the time, it felt like such a thought-provoking subject that we\u2019d never really discussed before.</p> <p>The conversation started when I casually mentioned that I thought I had the ability to predict my own future, at least in the short term. This might seem a bit odd, but what I meant was that I had a clear idea of what was going to happen on a daily basis. I knew my class schedule, when I would have breaks, what homework I needed to do, and even which teacher would be teaching each subject. To me, this gave me a sense of predicting the flow of my day, almost as if I could foresee every detail of the next few hours. I jokingly said that if I could predict my own timetable with such certainty, maybe I had some hidden ability to predict other aspects of the future as well.</p> <p>However, my best friend didn\u2019t agree with me at all. She thought I was being a bit too literal and said that predicting the future was much more complex than knowing what classes you\u2019re going to take. She argued that true prediction had to go beyond just routine events and needed to involve a deeper understanding of life, people, and the world around us. To her, predicting the future meant understanding things like global events, personal relationships, or even life-changing decisions\u2014things that weren\u2019t just a matter of knowing a schedule or plan.</p> <p>As we continued our discussion, I found it really interesting to hear her point of view. She started to tell me that some people, like scientists or philosophers, might be able to predict things based on data and research, but she felt that true prediction required more than just logical reasoning. It had to involve a kind of intuition or foresight that went beyond the rational understanding of the present. Though we had very different ideas about what it meant to predict the future, we recognized that both views could be valid in their way.</p> <p>What made this discussion so fascinating was that we both tried to make sense of something that seemed very abstract. We didn\u2019t come to any conclusions, but the conversation sparked a deeper interest in how we think about time, destiny, and control over our lives. It made me realize that predicting the future is not as simple as I once thought\u2014it involves many layers of thinking, from knowing our routines to trying to understand bigger life events.</p> <p>After that day, I found myself thinking a lot about how we define the future and whether we have control over it, or if it\u2019s something entirely beyond our understanding. We still talk about similar topics now, but that walk around the playground remains one of the most interesting and thought-provoking conversations we\u2019ve had.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#service","title":"Service","text":"<p>\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1aexceptional service at clothing shop</p> <p>So, ok, today so I\u2019d like to talk about a time when I received some really exceptional service\uff08\u8d85\u7ea7\u68d2\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff09 at this little clothing shop near my house.

This helped me connect the spoken words with their written form, and it also allowed me to learn new vocabulary and expressions. The great thing about watching movies and TV shows is that they expose you to various accents and colloquial language, which is often not covered in traditional language lessons.</p> <p>I chose to watch a variety of genres, from dramas to comedies, and even documentaries. I wanted to get used to different tones, speeds of speaking, and formal versus informal language. For example, I watched 2 Broke Girls. They use everyday, conversational English, which helped me sound more natural in casual conversations. Additionally, watching documentaries or news programs helped me improve my formal language and understanding of more complex vocabulary.</p> <p>Another benefit of this approach was that it made learning English more enjoyable. Instead of seeing it as a task, I started to look forward to the next episode or movie, and without realizing it, I was learning new phrases and improving my listening skills.

It\u2019s about our French Bulldog, Gama, and his funny encounters with the neighborhood cats. It was really funny that I couldn't stop laughing when hearing it!</p> <p>So, here\u2019s what happened. Gama is a curious little guy\u2014full of energy and always eager to explore. One day, my mom took him out for his usual walk around our neighborhood. As they were strolling down a street, they came across a group of three or four cats lounging in the sun.</p> <p>Now, Gama, being his usual friendly self, decided to approach them. He perked up\uff08\u632f\u594b\uff09 his little stubby tail, wiggling \u626d\u52a8 his entire backside in excitement as he tried to greet them. However, the cats, being aloof \u51b7\u6de1\u7684 as they often are, weren\u2019t too impressed with Gama\u2019s enthusiasm. According to my mom, one of the cats even gave a warning hiss. But instead of getting scared, Gama just tilted his head, almost like he was trying to figure out why they weren\u2019t as happy to see him.</p> <p>My mom was a bit nervous that the situation might escalate, but instead of attacking, the cats just stared at Gama, clearly perplexed. Eventually, one of the cats, probably the leader, cautiously approached him, gave him a quick sniff, and then walked off as if to say, \"You\u2019re not worth my time.\"</p> <p>What I found most hilarious \u6781\u5176\u6ed1\u7a3d\u7684 about this story is that Gama, despite his confident attitude, ended up looking so puzzled when the cats ignored him. My mom described how he kept tilting his head from side to side with his big watery eyes, trying to make sense of what had just happened. It was like he was expecting some sort of grand interaction, but got a cold shoulder.</p> <p>This story really stuck with me because it perfectly captures Gama\u2019s personality\u2014he\u2019s always so enthusiastic and eager to make friends, even if the other animals don\u2019t quite reciprocate. Hearing my mom describe it so vividly made me feel like I was right there with them, and it reminded me of how much I miss those little moments with Gama when I\u2019m away.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking1.html#video","title":"Video","text":"<p>\u5b66\u5230\u65b0\u4e1c\u897f\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u9891</p> <p>Ok, off the top of my head\uff08\u9996\u5148\u60f3\u5230\u7684\uff09, I\u2019m thinking about my experience of learning how to bake a cake through an online video on social media.</p> <p>I\u2019m not much of a baker, but my mum\u2019s birthday was coming up, and I thought, why not give it a try\uff08\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u8bd5\u8bd5\u5462\uff09?

I remembered hearing about The Wandering Earth, which had become incredibly popular in China. It\u2019s adapted from a novel by Liu Cixin, a renowned Chinese science fiction author. Knowing it was based on his story piqued my interest since his novel The Three-Body Problem is one of my favorites.</p> <p>The movie is set in a distant future where the Sun starts expanding into a red giant, threatening to destroy Earth. To survive, humanity devises \u8bbe\u8ba1 a bold plan: constructing 10 thousand gigantic engines to push the Earth out of the Solar System toward a new star system. The plot centers around a young man named Qi, his adoptive sister Han Duoduo, and his astronaut father, Liu Peiqiang, who plays a crucial role in this daring mission.</p> <p>What really drew me in was the unique concept. Instead of following the typical sci-fi storyline involving spaceships, it imagines moving the entire Earth\u2014a completely novel idea. The special effects were breathtaking, especially the scenes where Earth narrowly avoids being pulled into Jupiter\u2019s gravitational field.</p> <p>On top of the spectacular visuals, the movie carries powerful themes of sacrifice, family bonds, and global cooperation. Liu Peiqiang\u2019s ultimate sacrifice to save humanity was especially moving. I also appreciated how it explored the resilience of the human spirit in the face of unimaginable challenges.</p> <p>Overall, watching The Wandering Earth turned out to be the perfect way to escape my summer boredom. It wasn\u2019t just an entertaining sci-fi blockbuster; it was also thought-provoking and deeply emotional.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html","title":"IELTS Speaking","text":"<p> \u7ea6 57901 \u4e2a\u5b57  \u9884\u8ba1\u9605\u8bfb\u65f6\u95f4 193 \u5206\u949f</p> <p>2025.1-4</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#part1","title":"Part1","text":""},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#1","title":"\u30101 \u6708\u65b0\u9898\u3011","text":""},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#1colors16","title":"\uff081\uff09Colors\uff081.6\uff09","text":"<ol> <li>What's your favorite color?</li> </ol> <p>My favorite color is light green.

I'm more practical when it comes to shopping, so I prioritize functionality over appearance.

It was for a brand of mineral water, and what made it memorable was its unique storytelling approach. The ad featured a man and a woman trapped in a rock cave, and while the story was dramatic and engaging, it didn't seem to have much to do with the water itself. I remember being fascinated by the creativity, even though I didn't fully understand the connection at the time.</p> <ol> <li>Do you see a lot of advertising on trains or other transport?</li> </ol> <p>Yes, I see a lot of advertising on public transport, especially on subways. There are posters and digital screens everywhere. It's hard to miss them because they're strategically placed in high-traffic areas, like inside the train cars or on the platform walls. While some ads are creative, others can feel a bit overwhelming due to their sheer volume.</p> <ol> <li>Do you like advertisements?</li> </ol> <p>No, not really. I find that advertisements often consume a lot of my time without adding much value to my life.

While I understand their purpose, I generally find them more annoying than helpful.</p> <ol> <li>What kind of advertising do you like?</li> </ol> <p>I prefer storytelling ads that don't directly promote a specific product. These ads often use creative narratives or emotional themes to engage the audience, making them more memorable and enjoyable to watch. For example, I've seen ads that tell a heartwarming story or showcase a unique concept, and only at the end do they subtly introduce the product. I find this approach much more appealing than traditional ads that simply push a product in your face.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#5computers","title":"\uff085\uff09Computers","text":"<ol> <li>In what conditions would you use a computer?</li> </ol> <p>I use a computer mainly for studying and programming since I'm majoring in software engineering.

Modern buildings are designed with convenience and comfort in mind, featuring amenities like elevators, better insulation, and advanced facilities.

In such situations, it becomes challenging to balance everything, and I often have to adjust my schedule or sacrifice some personal time to meet deadlines.</p> <ol> <li>Do you like being busy?</li> </ol> <p>Yes, I do like being busy because it gives me a sense of fulfillment and purpose. When I'm busy, I feel like I'm making progress and achieving something meaningful.

It's a creative outlet that allows me to express my thoughts and ideas visually. Even though I'm not a professional artist, I find the process relaxing and fulfilling, especially when I can see my progress over time.</p> <ol> <li>Do you like to go to the gallery?</li> </ol> <p>No, I don't usually go to galleries because I feel like I don't have the knack for appreciating works of art. While I admire the talent and effort behind art, I often struggle to understand the deeper meanings or techniques, which makes the experience less enjoyable for me.</p> <ol> <li>Do you want to learn more about art?</li> </ol> <p>No, I'm not particularly interested in learning more about art. While I respect artists and their work, it's not something I feel passionate about exploring further. I prefer focusing on hobbies and activities that align more closely with my interests, like drawing for fun.</p> <ol> <li>Did you learn drawing when you were a kid?</li> </ol> <p>Yes, I did take drawing lessons when I was a kid. However, I had to give up because the institution moved to a location that was too far from my home. It was disappointing at the time, but I still enjoy drawing as a casual hobby whenever I have the chance.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#23taking-photos","title":"\uff0823\uff09Taking photos","text":"<ol> <li>Do you like taking photos?</li> </ol> <p>Not really. I prefer appreciating the views or shows directly with my eyes rather than through a camera. I feel that sometimes focusing on taking photos can distract me from fully experiencing the moment. For me, the memory of being present and enjoying the scenery or event is more meaningful than capturing it in a picture. That said, I do take photos occasionally, especially when I want to share something special with friends or family.</p> <ol> <li>Do you like taking selfies?</li> </ol> <p>I sometimes take selfies, especially when I'm out with friends. It's a fun way to capture memories and document our time together. However, I don't take selfies too often because I prefer candid or natural shots rather than posed ones. It's more about the moment than the photo itself for me.</p> <ol> <li> <p>What's your favorite family photo?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you want to improve your photography skills?</p> </li> </ol> <p>Yes, I'd love to improve my photography skills because I think it's a very useful and creative skill to have. Taking beautiful photos gives me a sense of achievement, and I enjoy the process of capturing moments in a visually appealing way. However, I don't have much time to practice right now due to my busy schedule, but it's something I'd like to focus on in the future.</p> <ol> <li>Where do you like to go to take photos?</li> </ol> <p>I like taking photos at picturesque places, such as parks, beaches, or historical sites. These locations often have stunning scenery or unique architecture, which makes for great photo opportunities. I also enjoy capturing moments during trips or special events because those photos hold a lot of sentimental value.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#24sports-program","title":"\uff0824\uff09Sports program","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Do you like watching sports programs on TV?</p> </li> <li> <p>Do you like to watch live sports games?</p> </li> </ol> <p>No, I'm not really fond of sports, so I don't enjoy watching live sports games.

However, if I had to choose, I might consider watching something more interactive or visually engaging, like esports or virtual reality games. These types of games are more appealing to me because they combine technology and creativity, which I find interesting.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Do you prefer to watch sports games alone or with a group of friends?</p> </li> <li> <p>Have you ever watched a sports game in a stadium?</p> </li> </ol> <p>No. </p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#25hobby","title":"\uff0825\uff09Hobby","text":"<ol> <li>Do you have any hobbies?</li> </ol> <p>Yes, I have a few hobbies that I really enjoy.

Those memories are still very special to me.</p> <ol> <li>Do you have a hobby that you've had since childhood?</li> </ol> <p>No, my hobbies have changed over time, partly because of the influence of the Internet and mobile phones.

Jobs that require a lot of physical work typically include construction work, farming, manufacturing, and roles in the service industry like cleaning or delivery services. These jobs often involve heavy lifting, long hours of standing, or repetitive tasks that demand physical strength and endurance. For example, construction workers need to carry heavy materials and operate machinery, while farmers spend hours in the fields under challenging weather conditions. These roles are essential for society but can be quite demanding on the body.</p> <p>2. What's the difference between the payment for physical work and that for mental work? Generally, jobs that require mental work, such as those in technology, finance, or management, tend to offer higher salaries compared to physical labor jobs. This is because mental work often involves specialized skills, education, and decision-making responsibilities, which are highly valued in the job market. On the other hand, physical work, while equally important, is sometimes seen as less specialized and more replaceable, which can lead to lower wages. However, there are exceptions, such as skilled tradespeople or athletes, who can earn significant incomes due to their expertise or physical abilities.</p> <p>3. Can physical workers receive higher salaries in the future? It's possible, but it depends on several factors. For instance, if there's a shortage of physical workers in certain industries, their salaries might increase due to higher demand. Additionally, as automation becomes more common, skilled physical workers who can operate or maintain advanced machinery might see their wages rise. However, in many cases, physical work may still be undervalued compared to mental work unless there's a significant shift in how society perceives and rewards these roles.</p> <p>4.

She didn't have a formal education in agriculture, but she had a lot of practical experience and understood the land, the seasons, and how to grow different crops.</p> <p>Being a farmer requires a wide range of skills. For example, you need to be physically strong because farming involves a lot of manual labor, like planting, harvesting, and carrying heavy loads. You also need to be patient and resilient because farming depends heavily on the weather, and sometimes crops can fail due to droughts or floods. Additionally, my grandmother had to be very resourceful and creative in solving problems, like finding ways to protect crops from pests or managing limited resources.</p> <p>As for whether I'd like to have this job in the future, I don't think so. While I deeply respect my grandmother's hard work and dedication, farming is a very demanding job, both physically and mentally. I also think it's quite unpredictable because of factors like climate change, which makes it even more challenging. However, I do admire the connection to nature and the sense of independence that comes with farming. It's just not the right career path for me personally.</p> <p>Part 3 \u5f85\u66f4\u65b0</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#8","title":"\uff088\uff09\u8bb8\u4e0b\u7684\u627f\u8bfa","text":"<p>Describe a time you made a promise to someone</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>What the promise was</p> <p>To whom you made it</p> <p>Whether it was easy or difficult to keep</p> <p>And explain why you made it</p> <p>I'd like to talk about a promise I made to my cousin a few years ago. At the time, she was preparing for her final high school exams, and she was feeling extremely stressed and overwhelmed. She had always struggled with math, and she was worried that she wouldn't be able to pass the exam. One evening, she came to me, almost in tears, and asked for my help. I promised her that I would tutor her every day until her exams and help her improve her math skills.</p> <p>After I made the promise, I felt a strong sense of responsibility to keep it. At first, I thought it would be easy because I was confident in my own math abilities, but it turned out to be more challenging than I expected. I had to sacrifice a lot of my free time to sit with her, explain concepts, and practice problems. There were moments when I felt frustrated because she didn't grasp things as quickly as I hoped, but I reminded myself of the promise I had made and pushed through.</p> <p>The reason I made this promise was because I could see how much it meant to her. She trusted me to help her, and I didn't want to let her down. I also knew how important these exams were for her future, and I wanted to do everything I could to support her. In the end, she managed to pass her math exam with a decent grade, and she was incredibly grateful for my help. Seeing her relief and happiness made all the effort worthwhile.</p> <p>This experience taught me the importance of keeping promises, especially when they involve someone who depends on you. It also strengthened my relationship with my cousin, as she knew she could count on me when she needed help the most.</p> <p>1. Why do some people fail to keep their promises? There are several reasons why people might fail to keep their promises. Sometimes, it's due to unforeseen circumstances, such as sudden illness or emergencies, which make it impossible to follow through. Other times, people might overcommit themselves and realize they don't have the time or resources to fulfill their promises. In some cases, a lack of sincerity or responsibility can also lead to broken promises, as individuals might make commitments without intending to keep them. Additionally, poor communication or misunderstandings can result in promises being unintentionally broken.</p> <p>2. Do children keep their promises? Children often try to keep their promises, but their ability to do so depends on their age, maturity, and understanding of the commitment. Younger children might struggle to keep promises because they are still learning about responsibility and the importance of follow-through. For example, a child might promise to clean their room but get distracted by playing. However, as children grow older and develop a stronger sense of accountability, they are more likely to keep their promises, especially if they understand the consequences of breaking them.</p> <p>3. Do parents in China make promises to their children? Yes, parents in China, like parents everywhere, often make promises to their children. These promises can range from small, everyday commitments, like buying a toy or taking them to the park, to more significant ones, such as rewarding good grades or planning a family vacation. Promises are often used as a way to motivate children or encourage positive behavior. However, Chinese parents generally emphasize the importance of keeping promises to teach their children about trust and responsibility, as these values are deeply rooted in Chinese culture.</p> <p>4. What kinds of promises do people often make? People make a wide variety of promises depending on the context. In personal relationships, promises often revolve around emotional commitments, such as being supportive or staying loyal. In professional settings, promises might include meeting deadlines, delivering quality work, or fulfilling contractual obligations. On a daily basis, people might make smaller promises, like showing up on time or helping a friend with a task. Additionally, people often make promises to themselves, such as committing to a healthier lifestyle or learning a new skill. These promises reflect the values and priorities of individuals in different aspects of life.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#9","title":"\uff089\uff09\u8bd7\u53e5/\u6b4c\u8bcd","text":"<p>Describe a line (or a few words) that you remember from a poem or song</p> <p>You should say</p> <p>What it is</p> <p>Which song or poem it is from</p> <p>How you knew it</p> <p>And explain how you feel about it</p> <p>One line that has always stayed with me is from Shakespeare's Sonnet 18. The line is, \u201cShall I compare thee to a summer's day?\u201d It's the opening line of the sonnet, and it's one of the most famous lines in English literature. The poem itself is a beautiful tribute(\u81f4\u656c) to the timeless beauty of a loved one, and this line sets the tone for the entire piece.</p> <p>I first came across this poem in high school during an English literature class. We were studying Shakespeare, and our teacher had us analyze several of his sonnets. This one stood out to me because of its romantic and poetic language. I remember being struck by how simple yet profound the opening line was. It immediately draws you in and makes you curious about what the comparison will be.</p> <p>The reason this line resonates with me so much is because of its elegance and universality. It's a question that feels both personal and timeless as if Shakespeare is speaking directly to the reader. I also love how it captures the fleeting beauty of summer and contrasts it with the eternal beauty of the person he's describing. It's a reminder of how powerful words can be in expressing emotions and ideas.</p> <p>Whenever I think of this line, I feel a sense of admiration for Shakespeare's ability to convey such deep feelings in just a few words. It also makes me appreciate the beauty of poetry and how it can connect people across time and cultures. Even though the poem was written centuries ago, its message still feels relevant and moving today.</p> <p>1. Are you good at memorizing things? I would say I'm fairly good at memorizing things, especially if they interest me or if I can connect them to something meaningful. For example, I find it easier to remember lyrics to songs I enjoy or facts related to topics I'm passionate about. However, I struggle with memorizing random or abstract information unless I use techniques like repetition, visualization, or creating associations. Overall, my ability to memorize depends on the context and how much effort I put into it.</p> <p>2. Do you think children would like the rhythm of songs or poems? Why? Yes, I think children are naturally drawn to the rhythm of songs and poems because it makes the content more engaging and fun. The repetitive and melodic nature of rhymes and rhythms helps capture their attention and makes it easier for them to remember the words. For example, nursery rhymes or children's songs often use simple, catchy patterns that appeal to young listeners. Additionally, the rhythm adds an element of playfulness, which aligns with children's love for creativity and imagination.</p> <p>3. Do you think it is easier for children to learn a song or poem than adults? Why? Yes, I believe it's generally easier for children to learn songs or poems compared to adults. Children have a more flexible and receptive mind, which allows them to absorb new information quickly. They are also less self-conscious and more willing to engage with creative and repetitive activities, which aids memorization. On the other hand, adults might overthink or struggle to find time to practice due to their busy schedules. However, adults who are motivated or have a strong interest in music or poetry can still learn effectively.</p> <p>4. What can people learn from songs or poems? People can learn a great deal from songs and poems, as they often convey emotions, stories, and cultural values. For example, songs and poems can teach us about history, traditions, and social issues, providing insights into different perspectives and experiences. They also help improve language skills, such as vocabulary, pronunciation, and rhythm. Additionally, songs and poems can inspire creativity, empathy, and self-expression, allowing people to connect with their own emotions and those of others. Overall, they are powerful tools for both education and personal growth.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#10","title":"\uff0810\uff09\u8fd1\u671f\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u8ba1\u5212","text":"<p>Describe a plan that you had to change recently</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>When this happened</p> <p>What made you change the plan</p> <p>What the new plan was</p> <p>And how you felt about the change</p> <p>I'd like to talk about a recent change in my plans regarding my future career and education. This happened just last month when I was faced with a big decision about my next steps after graduating from college.</p> <p>Originally, my plan was to start looking for a job right after graduation. I had already begun preparing my resume and researching companies in my field. However, last month, I attended a seminar about studying abroad, and it completely changed my perspective. The speaker shared their experiences of studying overseas, and I realized how much it could broaden my horizons, both academically and personally. After giving it some serious thought, I decided to change my plan and pursue a master's degree abroad instead of entering the job market immediately.</p> <p>The new plan involves applying to universities in countries like the UK or Canada, which are known for their excellent programs in my field. I've started preparing for language tests like IELTS and researching scholarships to fund my studies. It's a big shift from my original plan, but I feel it's the right decision for my long-term growth.</p> <p>At first, I felt a bit anxious about the change because it meant stepping out of my comfort zone and delaying my entry into the workforce. However, as I started researching and talking to people who had studied abroad, I became more excited and confident about this new direction. I believe this change will open up more opportunities for me in the future, and I'm looking forward to the challenges and experiences that come with studying in a different country.</p> <p>1. Do people often change their plans? Yes, people often change their plans due to various reasons. Sometimes, unexpected circumstances like bad weather, illness, or work emergencies can force them to adjust their schedules. Other times, people might change their plans because they find better alternatives or simply change their minds. For example, someone might decide to stay home instead of going out if they feel tired or if a more appealing opportunity arises. Flexibility is a natural part of life, and adapting to changes is essential for managing priorities effectively.</p> <p>2. Would you tell others if you change your plan? Yes, but only to those who are directly affected by the change or are important to me. For instance, if I cancel a meeting with a friend, I would inform them immediately to avoid inconvenience. Similarly, if I change plans that involve family or colleagues, I would let them know as soon as possible. However, for plans that don't impact others, I might not feel the need to share the change. Communication is key to maintaining trust and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.</p> <p>3. Why do you think parents still make plans for their children nowadays? Parents often make plans for their children because they want to ensure their well-being and success. For example, they might plan their education, extracurricular activities, or even future careers to provide them with the best opportunities. Parents also make plans to instill discipline and structure in their children's lives, which they believe will help them grow into responsible adults. Additionally, some parents might feel that their experience and knowledge can guide their children in making better decisions, especially in a competitive and fast-changing world.</p> <p>4. How does technology help people make plans? Technology plays a significant role in helping people make and manage plans efficiently. For instance, calendar apps and reminder tools allow individuals to organize their schedules, set deadlines, and receive notifications about upcoming events. Communication platforms like email or messaging apps make it easy to coordinate plans with others, even across long distances. Additionally, travel and booking apps help people plan trips, accommodations, and activities seamlessly. Overall, technology simplifies the planning process and ensures that people can stay organized and informed.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#11","title":"\uff0811\uff09\u5bb6\u5ead\u91cd\u8981\u8bbe\u5907","text":"<p>Describe a piece of equipment that is important in your home</p> <p>You should say: What it is How often you use it With whom you use it And explain why it is important</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about the air conditioner in my home, which is one of the most important pieces of equipment for me and my family.

In the summer, when the temperature can get extremely high, the air conditioner is a lifesaver. It keeps our home cool and comfortable, making it possible to relax and sleep without feeling overwhelmed by the heat. Similarly, during the winter, when it gets uncomfortably cold, we use the air conditioner to maintain a warm and cozy indoor environment. Even though we don\u2019t use it year-round, it\u2019s during these seasons that we truly appreciate its value.</p> <p>The air conditioner is important to us for several reasons. First, it significantly improves our quality of life by keeping our home at a comfortable temperature during extreme weather. Second, it helps us stay productive, as it\u2019s difficult to focus on work or studies when it\u2019s too hot or too cold.

Located in the Pudong district of Shanghai, it stands along the Huangpu River and is surrounded by other impressive skyscrapers, making it a central part of the city's stunning skyline.</p> <p>The Oriental Pearl TV Tower is a unique and futuristic-looking building. It's incredibly tall, standing at 468 meters, and its design is inspired by a poem about pearls falling onto a jade plate. The tower consists of several large spheres at different levels, connected by vertical columns, which give it a distinctive and elegant appearance. At night, the tower is illuminated with colorful lights, making it even more striking and visually appealing.</p> <p>The tower serves multiple functions. Primarily, it's a TV and radio broadcasting tower, but it has also become a major tourist attraction. Inside, there are observation decks that offer breathtaking views of Shanghai, as well as a revolving restaurant where visitors can enjoy a meal while taking in the panoramic(\u5168\u666f\u7684)  scenery. Additionally, the tower houses a museum dedicated to the history of Shanghai, which adds an educational element to its appeal.</p> <p>What makes the Oriental Pearl TV Tower so interesting to me is its combination of architectural innovation, cultural significance, and functionality. It's not just a building; it's a symbol of Shanghai's rapid development and modernization. Every time I visit, I'm amazed by how it blends art, technology, and history into one structure. It's a must-see for anyone visiting Shanghai, and it never fails to leave a lasting impression.</p> <p>**1. What types of buildings are popular in your country? ** In China, ancient buildings are highly popular and admired for their cultural and historical significance. Traditional Chinese architecture, such as palaces, temples, and courtyard homes, reflects the country's rich heritage. For example, the Forbidden City in Beijing and the ancient water towns in Suzhou are iconic examples of Chinese architecture, featuring intricate designs, wooden structures, and symbolic elements like curved roofs and dragon motifs. These buildings are not only tourist attractions but also serve as a reminder of China's artistic and engineering achievements throughout history.</p> <p>2. Is it worth spending a lot of money on the exterior appearance of a building? Spending money on the exterior appearance of a building can be worth it, depending on the purpose and context. For iconic structures like museums, government buildings, or cultural landmarks, an impressive exterior can enhance their significance and attract visitors. However, for residential or functional buildings, it's more important to balance aesthetics with practicality and cost-effectiveness. While a visually appealing exterior can create a positive impression, the focus should also be on durability, sustainability, and the building's overall functionality.</p> <p>3. Is it more important for a building to look good on the outside or on the inside? I believe the inside of a building is more important than the outside because it directly impacts the comfort and usability of the space. A well-designed interior ensures that the building meets the needs of its occupants, whether it's for living, working, or leisure. For example, good lighting, ventilation, and layout are essential for creating a functional and pleasant environment. That said, the exterior appearance is also important, as it contributes to the building's identity and can influence people's perceptions. Ideally, a balance between the two should be achieved.</p> <p>4. Why do people like to visit historical sites? People visit historical sites for various reasons. Firstly, these sites offer a glimpse into the past, allowing visitors to learn about history, culture, and traditions. For example, exploring ancient ruins or castles can provide insights into how people lived centuries ago. Secondly, historical sites often have unique architectural and artistic value, making them visually captivating. Additionally, visiting such places can evoke a sense of connection to one's heritage or inspire awe at human achievements. Lastly, historical sites are often surrounded by stories and legends, which add an element of intrigue and fascination.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#13","title":"\uff0813\uff09\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u7535\u89c6\u5267","text":"<p>Describe a TV series you like You should say: What is the name of the TV series When you watched it What it is about And explain why you like it</p> <p>Mysterious lotus casebook\uff08\u83b2\u82b1\u697c\uff0c\u6b66\u88c5\u53e4\u4fa0\u60ac\u7591\u5267\uff09</p> <p>I'd like to talk about a TV series called Mysterious Lotus Casebook, which is a Chinese historical mystery drama. I watched it last year, and it quickly became one of my favorite shows because of its intriguing plot and well-developed characters.</p> <p>The series is set in fictional ancient China and follows the story of a brilliant but enigmatic detective who solves complex cases while uncovering secrets from his own past.

Inserting advertisements within a TV series can be beneficial for broadcasters and advertisers, but it often disrupts the viewing experience for the audience. For broadcasters, ads generate revenue, which helps fund the production of high-quality content. Advertisers also benefit by reaching a large and engaged audience. However, for viewers, frequent ad breaks can be frustrating, especially during intense or emotional scenes. While ads are necessary for the industry, finding a balance between commercial interests and viewer satisfaction is crucial.</p> <p>2. Do you think that parents should limit their children from watching television? Yes, I believe parents should limit their children's television time to ensure a healthy balance between screen time and other activities. Excessive TV watching can lead to issues like reduced physical activity, poor sleep quality, and exposure to inappropriate content. However, television can also be educational if children watch age-appropriate programs that stimulate their curiosity and learning. Parents should set reasonable limits and encourage alternative activities, such as reading, playing outdoors, or engaging in creative hobbies, to promote overall development.</p> <p>3. Would your family watch TV together? Yes, my family occasionally watches TV together, especially during special occasions or when there's a program that interests everyone. For example, we might watch a popular reality show, a sports event, or a movie during weekends or holidays. Watching TV together provides an opportunity for bonding and shared enjoyment. However, due to busy schedules and differing preferences, it's not something we do every day. When we do, it's a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend quality time as a family.</p> <p>4. What are the differences in television viewing habits between the elderly and young people? There are significant differences in television viewing habits between the elderly and young people. Elderly individuals often prefer traditional TV channels and watch programs like news, dramas, or documentaries at scheduled times. They tend to value the routine and familiarity of linear TV. On the other hand, young people are more likely to use streaming platforms like BiliBili or YouTube, where they can watch content on demand and binge-watch entire series. They also prefer genres like reality shows, comedies, or online videos, reflecting their desire for convenience and entertainment tailored to their interests.</p> <p>5. How has technology changed the way people watch television? Technology has revolutionized the way people watch television by introducing on-demand streaming, personalized content, and multi-device accessibility. Platforms like iQIYI and youku allow viewers to watch their favorite shows anytime, anywhere, without being tied to a TV schedule. Smart TVs and devices like Roku or Chromecast have made it easier to access a wide range of content. Additionally, social media and recommendation algorithms help users discover new shows based on their preferences.

Annie's sharing has made a positive impact on my life, and I'm lucky to have her as a friend.</p> <p>1. What kinds of emotional support do people need at work? People need various types of emotional support at work to maintain their well-being and productivity. For example, they might need encouragement and recognition for their efforts, especially during challenging projects or stressful periods. A supportive work environment where colleagues and managers listen to their concerns and offer constructive feedback is also crucial.

Emotional support helps employees feel valued, motivated, and less overwhelmed, which ultimately benefits both the individual and the organization.</p> <p>2.

However, I would be cautious about oversharing personal emotions, as maintaining professionalism is important in the workplace. In general, I believe open communication can strengthen teamwork and create a supportive atmosphere, but it's essential to strike a balance and respect boundaries.</p> <p>3. Is it possible to know a job applicant's emotional resilience through the recruiting process? Yes, to some extent, it is possible to assess a job applicant's emotional resilience during the recruiting process. For example, behavioral interview questions that ask about past challenges and how they were handled can provide insights into their ability to cope with stress and adversity. Additionally, situational judgment tests or role-playing exercises can reveal how candidates manage pressure and solve problems in real-time. However, emotional resilience is complex and may not be fully understood until the person is actually in the role and facing day-to-day challenges.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#15","title":"\uff0815\uff09\u667a\u529b\u6e38\u620f","text":"<p>Describe a (jigsaw, crossword, etc) puzzle you have played</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>What it is like</p> <p>How easy or difficult it is</p> <p>How long it takes you to solve</p> <p>And how you feel about it</p> <p>One puzzle I've played a lot is Sudoku. Sudoku is a number puzzle that consists of a 9x9 grid, and the goal is to fill in the grid with numbers from 1 to 9 in such a way that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition. It's a logic-based puzzle, so you can't guess the numbers, and it requires a lot of careful thinking and reasoning.</p> <p>In terms of difficulty, I'd say it can vary. Some Sudoku puzzles are relatively easy, especially the ones labeled as \"easy\" in newspapers or apps, and you can solve them in about 10 to 20 minutes.

So overall, I feel a lot of satisfaction from solving Sudoku puzzles, and it's a good way to unwind after a busy day.</p> <p>1. Which do you think is better? A detective movie or its original novel? I think it depends on personal preference, but I would argue that the original novel is often better. Novels allow readers to immerse themselves in the story, explore the characters'  thoughts and motivations, and use their imagination to visualize the scenes. Detective novels, in particular, often include intricate details and clues that can be more engaging when read at one's own pace. However, detective movies can also be enjoyable because they bring the story to life with visuals, sound, and acting, making the experience more dynamic and accessible.</p> <p>2. Why are detective stories attractive to people? Detective stories are attractive because they stimulate curiosity and engage the mind. People enjoy the challenge of solving mysteries alongside the characters, piecing together clues, and trying to predict the outcome before it's revealed. The suspense and tension in these stories create a thrilling experience that keeps readers or viewers hooked. Additionally, detective stories often explore themes of justice, morality, and human psychology, which add depth and make them intellectually and emotionally rewarding.</p> <p>3. What kinds of puzzles improve people's intelligence? Puzzles like crosswords, Sudoku, and logic games are great for improving intelligence because they enhance problem-solving skills, memory, and critical thinking. Jigsaw puzzles can improve spatial awareness and patience, while riddles and brain teasers encourage creative thinking and mental flexibility. Strategy-based puzzles, such as chess or escape room challenges, also help develop planning and decision-making abilities. These activities stimulate different parts of the brain, making them effective tools for cognitive development.</p> <p>4. Why do parents let their children play puzzles? Parents encourage their children to play puzzles because they are both fun and educational. Puzzles help children develop essential skills like problem-solving, hand-eye coordination, and concentration. They also teach patience and perseverance, as children learn to work through challenges step by step. Additionally, puzzles can be a great way for children to bond with family members or friends, fostering social skills and teamwork. Overall, puzzles are a valuable tool for promoting cognitive and emotional growth in a playful and engaging way.</p> <p>5. How can technology and intellectual games be combined better? Technology and intellectual games can be combined better by creating interactive and immersive experiences. For example, mobile apps and online platforms can offer personalized puzzles and games that adapt to the user's skill level, making them more engaging and effective.

Badminton is one of the most popular sports in the world.  I usually play it indoors, especially when the weather isn't ideal for outdoor sports.</p> <p>I play badminton at least two or three times a week. I often play with friends at the court in school. It's one of my go-to activities to stay active and also have fun.</p> <p>I first learned to play badminton when I was in primary school, around 10 years old. Initially, I wasn't very good at it, but I joined a school club where we had a coach who taught us the fundamentals, like how to serve, how to hold the racket, and how to move around the court. Over the years, I improved by practicing with friends and watching professional matches, which helped me understand the techniques and strategies better.</p> <p>There are several reasons why I enjoy badminton so much. First, it's a great workout. It's a very dynamic sport, requiring quick movements, jumps, and fast reflexes. Playing regularly has helped me improve my stamina and agility. Second, it's a very social sport. Whether I'm playing doubles with friends or participating in a friendly competition, it's always fun to connect with others while being active. Lastly, I find badminton to be a sport that requires a lot of concentration and skill, so it's challenging in a good way, and the more I play, the better I get at it. It's very rewarding to see progress and to be able to pull off tricky shots.</p> <p>Overall, badminton is not only fun but also a great way for me to stay fit, sharpen my mind, and spend time with friends. That's why I really like playing it.</p> <p>1. Is sports important for children?</p> <p>Yes, I believe sports are incredibly important for children, both physically and mentally. On the physical side, sports help children build strength, improve their coordination, and develop healthy habits that can last a lifetime. Regular physical activity also reduces the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Mentally, sports can teach children essential life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Additionally, participating in sports can boost their self-confidence and help them manage stress. In today's digital age, where many children spend excessive time on screens, engaging in sports is even more crucial to ensure they stay active and healthy.</p> <p>2. How can we make children aware of the importance of sports?</p> <p>There are several ways we can make children aware of the importance of sports. First, schools and parents can play a significant role by encouraging participation in physical activities from a young age. For instance, schools could offer a wide variety of sports programs so children can find something they enjoy. Additionally, parents should lead by example by engaging in sports themselves, which would inspire their children to do the same. Media campaigns and advertisements promoting the benefits of sports can also be effective, especially when they target children and highlight role models who excel in sports. Finally, creating a positive and supportive environment where children are celebrated for their effort, rather than just their achievements, can motivate them to continue being active.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#17","title":"\uff0817\uff09\u73af\u4fdd\u4eba\u58eb","text":"<p>Describe a person who helps to protect the environment</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>Who this person is</p> <p>When this person does this</p> <p>What has the person done</p> <p>And explain why you think this person does this</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about my uncle, who is really passionate about protecting the environment. He\u2019s an environmental engineer, so he\u2019s always thinking about ways to make the world greener. But what\u2019s really cool is that he doesn\u2019t just talk about it\u2014he actually lives it every day.</p> <p>For example, he volunteers a lot in our community. He joins beach clean-ups and tree-planting events, and he even gets other people to come along. He also visits local schools to teach kids about recycling and how to waste less. Another thing he\u2019s done is help set up solar panels on some public buildings in our town, which is a great way to use clean energy.</p> <p>I think my uncle cares so much about the environment because he\u2019s really worried about climate change. He always says that even small actions can make a big difference if everyone pitches in. He loves nature and wants to make sure the planet stays healthy for future generations, especially for his own kids.</p> <p>What I admire most about him is how he leads by example. He doesn\u2019t force his ideas on anyone, but just by living his life in an eco-friendly way, he inspires others to do the same. He\u2019s made a real impact in our community, and I think that\u2019s amazing.</p> <p>In short, my uncle is someone who truly cares about the environment, and I really look up to him for that.</p> <p>1. Why can recycling help the environment?</p> <p>Recycling can help the environment in several ways. First, it reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators, which helps minimize pollution and conserve space. By reusing materials like paper, plastic, and metal, we can also reduce the need to extract raw resources, which is often harmful to ecosystems. Additionally, recycling reduces energy consumption, as processing recycled materials generally uses less energy compared to manufacturing products from virgin materials. This, in turn, helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Overall, recycling plays a crucial role in promoting a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle.</p> <p>2. What have people done to damage the environment?</p> <p>Unfortunately, humans have done a lot to damage the environment over the years. One of the main ways we've harmed the environment is through deforestation, where vast areas of trees are cut down for agriculture, urbanization, or logging. This disrupts ecosystems, contributes to the loss of biodiversity, and accelerates climate change. Another major issue is pollution, whether it's air pollution from industrial activities, plastic pollution in the oceans, or chemical runoff into rivers and lakes. The overuse of fossil fuels has also led to the depletion of natural resources and increased carbon emissions, driving global warming. Additionally, overfishing and the destruction of habitats are contributing to the decline in wildlife populations.</p> <p>3. Do you think technology can improve environment-related problems?</p> <p>Yes, technology can definitely play a role in solving many environment-related problems. For example, renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, which would lower greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of pollution, advances in waste management and recycling technologies can help reduce the environmental impact of plastic and other materials. Moreover, technologies like electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances can reduce carbon footprints. On a larger scale, environmental monitoring systems powered by technology can help track pollution levels and predict environmental changes, allowing us to take proactive measures. However, while technology can offer solutions, it's important that these innovations are used alongside sustainable practices and policies.</p> <p>4. Is it important to teach students environmental protection at school?</p> <p>Yes, it's incredibly important to teach students about environmental protection at school. Educating children about environmental issues not only raises awareness but also empowers them to make sustainable choices as they grow older. Schools are an ideal place to instill values of environmental responsibility because they can influence students from a young age. By learning about climate change, recycling, and conservation, students can understand the long-term effects of human activities on the planet. Moreover, when students are educated on these issues, they are more likely to adopt eco-friendly habits, encourage others to do the same, and even advocate for policies that protect the environment in the future.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#18","title":"\uff0818\uff09\u60f3\u505a\u90e8\u5206\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u65b0\u6cd5\u5f8b","text":"<p>Describe a newly enacted law that you like but you want to change part of it</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>When it was enacted</p> <p>What the law is about</p> <p>Which part you want to change</p> <p>And explain why you want to change the part</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about a new law in my country that bans single-use plastics, like plastic bags and straws. I think it\u2019s a great law because it helps reduce plastic waste, which is a huge problem for the environment.</p> <p>The law requires businesses to stop using single-use plastics and switch to more eco-friendly alternatives, like paper or reusable materials. This is fantastic because it encourages people to be more mindful of their waste and helps protect oceans and wildlife from plastic pollution. I\u2019ve already noticed fewer plastic bags in stores, and it feels good to see people using reusable bags instead.</p> <p>However, there\u2019s one part of the law I\u2019d like to change. Right now, the alternatives to plastic, like paper straws or reusable bags, are more expensive for small businesses and customers. This can be a problem for people with lower incomes or small shops that can\u2019t afford the switch. I think the government should provide subsidies or discounts to help businesses and individuals make the transition easier. That way, everyone can afford to follow the law without feeling the financial pressure.</p> <p>Overall, I really support this law because it\u2019s a big step toward a cleaner environment. But if they could make it more affordable for everyone, I think it would be even better and more effective.</p> <p>1. Why is law important?</p> <p>Law is essential because it provides structure and order within society. It establishes clear guidelines for acceptable behavior, helping to prevent chaos and conflict. Laws protect individual rights, such as personal freedom, property, and security, ensuring that people can live in a safe and fair environment. Without law, there would be no system to resolve disputes or punish wrongdoers, which could lead to injustice and inequality. Additionally, laws play a crucial role in maintaining social harmony by setting out rules for how people should interact with each other. In a broader sense, they also help safeguard public health, the environment, and the economy by regulating industries and promoting fairness in business practices.</p> <p>2. Why are there people who like a law but want to change part of it?</p> <p>There are often people who appreciate the overall principles of a law but believe certain aspects of it need improvement. This can happen because laws are designed to address a wide range of issues, but they may not always be perfectly suited to every situation. Over time, social values, technology, and circumstances change, and laws that were once appropriate may no longer align with current needs or perspectives. For example, a law that works well in one context might be seen as outdated or unjust in another. People may want to change parts of a law if they feel it's unfair, too restrictive, or if they think it could be more effective in achieving its intended goals. In a democratic society, it's normal for people to question and challenge laws in order to make the system more just and equitable for everyone.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#19","title":"\uff0819\uff09\u73b0\u573a\u8868\u6f14","text":"<p>Describe a live performance you enjoyed watching</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>Who performed in it</p> <p>What kind of performance it was</p> <p>When you watched it</p> <p>And explain why you enjoyed watching it</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about a live performance of the musical Romeo and Juliet that I watched last year. It was an amazing experience, and I still remember it clearly.</p> <p>The performance was put on by a famous international theater company, and the actors were incredibly talented. The two leads who played Romeo and Juliet had such powerful voices and great acting skills\u2014they really made the characters come alive. The rest of the cast was fantastic too, and everyone worked so well together that the whole performance felt real and emotional.</p> <p>The musical was a modern version of Shakespeare\u2019s classic story, mixing old and new styles. The songs were beautiful, with some slow, emotional ones and others that were full of energy. The dancing was also really impressive, and the stage design and lighting made it feel like we were actually in Verona, the setting of the story.</p> <p>I went to see it with my friends during a weekend. We\u2019d been excited about it for weeks, and it didn\u2019t disappoint. The music, acting, and overall production were so good that it made the whole evening unforgettable.</p> <p>What I loved most was how the performance made the story\u2019s themes of love, conflict, and fate feel so modern and relatable. The actors were so talented, and the whole experience was so well put together that it left a deep impression on me. It was one of those rare moments where everything\u2014the music, the acting, and the atmosphere\u2014just clicked, and I left the theater feeling inspired and moved.</p> <p>1. What kind of party have you had so far? So far, I've had a few birthday parties, which were quite memorable. For example, on my 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, my friends and family organized a surprise party for me, complete with decorations, cake, and games. It was a mix of laughter, music, and heartfelt moments. I've also attended graduation parties and casual get-togethers with friends, but birthday parties stand out because they are personal and celebratory, marking special milestones in life.</p> <p>2. Do you think it is hard for people to perform in front of their friends? Yes, I think performing in front of friends can be challenging for many people because there's added pressure to impress or meet their expectations. Friends are often familiar with your personality and abilities, which can make you feel more self-conscious about making mistakes. However, for some, performing in front of friends can also be easier because they feel more supported and encouraged by people they trust. It really depends on the individual's confidence and the nature of their relationship with their friends.</p> <p>3. Is it easy to invite your friends to attend your party or your performance? It's usually easy to invite friends to a party or performance, especially if they are close to you and share similar interests. Most friends are happy to support you and enjoy the occasion together. However, it can sometimes be challenging if they have prior commitments or if the event requires a lot of time or effort. Clear communication and giving them enough notice can make the process smoother and increase the likelihood of their attendance.</p> <p>4. Is it expensive to watch a live performance in your country? The cost of watching a live performance in my country varies depending on the type of event and the venue\uff08\u6d3b\u52a8\u573a\u5730\uff09. For example, concerts by international artists or large-scale theater productions can be quite expensive, with ticket prices ranging from moderate to very high. On the other hand, local performances, such as community theater or smaller music gigs, are often more affordable. While some live performances can be costly, many people feel the experience is worth the price because of the unique atmosphere and connection with the performers.</p> <p>5. Why do many people prefer to watch a live performance rather than watch it on TV? Many people prefer live performances because they offer a unique and immersive experience that can't be replicated on TV. The energy of the crowd, the interaction with performers, and the spontaneity of live events create a sense of excitement and connection. For example, at a concert, the music feels more powerful, and you can see the artists'  emotions and efforts up close. Additionally, live performances often feel more authentic and memorable, making them a special experience that people are willing to pay for and cherish.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#20","title":"\uff0820\uff09\u4ef0\u6155\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458/\u4f53\u80b2\u961f","text":"<p>Describe an athlete/sports team you admire You should say: Who/what the athlete/sports team is Where/how you got to know the athlete/sports team How often you watch their sports games And explain why you admire the athlete/sports team</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about Sun Yingsha, a Chinese table tennis player who is one of the most talented and inspiring athletes I know.

Her passion for table tennis is evident in every match she plays, and she serves as a great role model for aspiring athletes.</p> <p>1. Do you think it is very important for students to do sports? Yes, I believe it is very important for students to participate in sports. Engaging in physical activities not only improves their physical health but also enhances mental well-being. For example, sports help reduce stress, boost concentration, and promote teamwork and leadership skills. Additionally, regular exercise can instill discipline and time management, as students learn to balance academics and extracurricular activities. Overall, sports play a vital role in the holistic development of students, preparing them for challenges both inside and outside the classroom.</p> <p>2. Does winning in a sports game make students feel proud? Yes, winning in a sports game often makes students feel proud because it validates their hard work, skills, and teamwork. The sense of achievement and recognition they receive from winning can boost their confidence and motivation. For example, scoring the winning goal or leading a team to victory can create lasting memories and a sense of accomplishment. However, it\u2019s important to emphasize that participation and effort are equally valuable, as they teach resilience and sportsmanship, regardless of the outcome.</p> <p>3. Do you think winning is everything in sports competitions? No, I don\u2019t think winning is everything in sports competitions. While winning can be rewarding, the true value of sports lies in the lessons learned through participation, such as teamwork, perseverance, and discipline. For instance, losing a game can teach students how to handle failure gracefully and strive for improvement. Additionally, sports foster friendships, physical fitness, and a sense of community, which are equally important. Focusing solely on winning can lead to unnecessary pressure and detract from the enjoyment and personal growth that sports offer.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#21227","title":"\uff0821\uff09\u4e0d\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e00\u5929\uff082.27 \u7591\u4f3c\u65b0\u9898\uff09","text":"<p>Describe a time you enjoyed a free day off work or school You should say: Where you were What you did Who you were with And how you felt about it</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about last weekend when I had a free day off from school and decided to visit West Lake with my roommate. It\u2019s really close to our campus, just a short metro ride away, so we didn\u2019t have to wake up early or rush. It was such a relaxing and fun day, and I really needed the break.</p> <p>We left in the early afternoon, and the weather was perfect\u2014sunny but not too hot, with a nice breeze. When we got to the lake, the atmosphere was so peaceful. We spent the first part of the day walking around the lake, enjoying the beautiful views of the water, willow trees, and mountains in the distance. The scenery was so pretty that we took lots of photos to remember it.</p> <p>Later, we found a quiet spot by the lake to watch the sunset. The sky turned into amazing shades of orange, pink, and purple, and it reflected on the water, making it look like a painting. It was so peaceful, and I felt completely relaxed. My roommate and I talked about life, school, and our plans for the future, which made the moment even more special.</p> <p>After the sunset, we checked out the nearby shopping area, which has a mix of traditional and modern shops. We bought some souvenirs and tried some local snacks, like dongpo pork and longjing tea. It was a really chill way to end the day, and we didn\u2019t feel rushed at all.</p> <p>What made this day so great was the combination of beautiful nature, good food, and spending time with my roommate. It helped me forget about school stress and just enjoy the moment. By the end of the day, I felt refreshed and happy. It reminded me how important it is to take breaks and appreciate the little things in life.</p> <p>1. Do people nowadays have more free time than in the past?  It\u2019s debatable whether people today have more free time than in the past. On one hand, advancements in technology and automation have reduced the time needed for many tasks, such as household chores or commuting. On the other hand, the fast-paced nature of modern life, with its demanding work schedules and constant connectivity, often leaves people feeling busier than ever. While some may have more free time in theory, they might struggle to use it effectively due to stress or distractions like social media.</p> <p>2. Do you think most people are able to manage their free time well?  I think many people struggle to manage their free time effectively. With so many distractions, such as smartphones, social media, and streaming platforms, it\u2019s easy to waste time without realizing it. Additionally, some people find it hard to balance work, family, and personal interests, leading to poor time management. However, those who prioritize planning and self-discipline, such as setting goals or using time management tools, are often more successful in making the most of their free time.</p> <p>3. What do people like to do when they are free in your country?  In my country, people enjoy a variety of activities during their free time. Many prefer relaxing at home, watching TV shows, or browsing social media. Others engage in outdoor activities like hiking, playing sports, or visiting parks. Socializing with friends and family over meals or coffee is also popular. Additionally, some people use their free time for hobbies like reading, painting, or gardening. Younger generations often spend time playing video games or exploring new trends online.</p> <p>4. What's the difference between the things people did in their free time in the past and the things they do nowadays?  In the past, people\u2019s free time activities were often more community-oriented and physically engaging. For example, they might gather for local festivals, play traditional games, or spend time outdoors. Nowadays, technology has transformed how people spend their free time, with many opting for screen-based activities like watching movies, playing video games, or scrolling through social media. While these activities are convenient, they are often more solitary and less physically active compared to the past.</p> <p>5. Why is working extra hours common nowadays?  Working extra hours has become common due to several factors. Firstly, the competitive job market pushes employees to work harder to secure their positions or advance their careers. Secondly, the rise of technology means people are constantly connected to their work, making it harder to \u201cswitch off.\u201d Additionally, some industries have high workloads or tight deadlines, requiring employees to put in extra hours. Lastly, financial pressures, such as rising living costs, often force people to take on more work to make ends meet.</p> <p>6. What can we do to stop working long hours?  To reduce long working hours, both individuals and organizations need to take action. Employers can promote a healthier work-life balance by setting clear boundaries, encouraging breaks, and offering flexible work arrangements. Employees should prioritize time management, set realistic goals, and learn to say no to excessive demands. Governments can also play a role by enforcing labor laws that limit working hours and protect employees\u2019 rights.

Located primarily in Brazil, the Amazon spans across several South American countries and is often referred to as the \"lungs of the planet\" because of its vast number of trees and its role in producing oxygen.</p> <p>I first learned about the Amazon Rainforest in school during a geography class. We studied its importance to the global ecosystem, its incredible variety of plant and animal species, and the challenges it faces due to deforestation. Since then, I\u2019ve been intrigued by this place and have watched documentaries and read articles about it, which have deepened my interest.</p> <p>The Amazon Rainforest is a lush, green paradise filled with towering trees, dense vegetation, and winding rivers. It\u2019s home to millions of species, including exotic birds, monkeys, jaguars \u7f8e\u6d32\u864e, and countless insects. The sheer scale of the forest is overwhelming\u2014it\u2019s so vast that it feels like an entirely different world.

It happened one afternoon while we were walking around the playground, just chatting and enjoying the fresh air. The topic we ended up discussing was \u201cpredicting the future,\u201d which might sound a bit unusual, but it turned out to be a really thought-provoking conversation.</p> <p>It all started when I casually mentioned that I felt like I could predict my own future, at least in the short term. What I meant was that I had a clear idea of what my day would look like\u2014like my class schedule, when I\u2019d have breaks, and what homework I needed to do. To me, that felt like predicting the future because I knew exactly what was coming next.</p> <p>But my friend didn\u2019t agree at all. She said that real prediction had to go beyond just knowing routines. To her, it meant understanding bigger things, like global events, relationships, or life-changing decisions. She thought true prediction required intuition and insight, not just logical thinking.</p> <p>As we kept talking, I found her perspective really fascinating. She even brought up(\u63d0\u51fa) how scientists and philosophers might predict things based on data, but she believed there was more to it than just facts and research. Even though we had different views, we both realized that our ideas could be valid in their own way.</p> <p>What made this discussion so interesting was that it made me think about time, destiny, and how much control we really have over our lives. We didn\u2019t come to any conclusions, but it definitely sparked my curiosity about the future and how we understand it.</p> <p>Even now, I still think about that conversation sometimes. It was one of the most thought-provoking discussions I\u2019ve ever had, and it\u2019s something I\u2019ll always remember.</p> <p>1. When do children normally form their own views?</p> <p>Children begin forming their own views around the age of 3 or 4, but their opinions become more defined as they grow older, especially during adolescence. By around 10 to 12 years old, children develop a clearer sense of identity and are more capable of forming independent opinions on social or moral issues.</p> <p>2. Do children have strong opinions?</p> <p>Yes, as children grow, especially during their teenage years, they often develop strong opinions on various topics like fairness, social issues, or politics. While their views might not always be fully informed, they can still be passionate and firm about them.</p> <p>3. Should parents request their kids to obey them?</p> <p>Parents should ask their children to obey rules for safety and discipline, but it's important to balance this with encouraging open communication. When children understand why rules are in place, they're more likely to respect them and develop a sense of responsibility.</p> <p>4. In what industries do you think communication is a necessary skill?</p> <p>Communication is crucial in many industries, particularly healthcare, education, customer service, and business. In each of these fields, clear communication ensures effective collaboration, problem-solving, and customer satisfaction, as well as smooth operation and safety.</p> <p>5. Should parents consider their children's opinions on everything? Why?</p> <p>Parents should consider their children's opinions, especially as they grow older, to promote independence and mutual respect. However, some decisions, like those involving safety or well-being, may need to be made by parents. It's about finding a healthy balance between guidance and listening.</p> <p>6. Why do some young people refuse to communicate with others?</p> <p>Some young people avoid communication due to social anxiety, shyness, or past negative experiences like bullying. Others may feel misunderstood or simply prefer solitude, especially if they are introverted. A supportive environment can help them feel more comfortable opening up.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#2_1","title":"\uff082\uff09\u7ae5\u5e74\u73a9\u5177","text":"<p>Describe a toy you liked in your childhood</p> <p>You should say</p> <p>What kind of toy it is</p> <p>When you received it</p> <p>How you played it</p> <p>And how you felt about it</p> <p>One toy I absolutely loved as a child was a dragon doll. I can still remember how excited I was when I first got it, as I had always been fascinated by dragons ever since I was little. I think my love for dragons started from reading fairy tales and watching animated movies where these mythical creatures were portrayed as powerful and majestic beings. So, when I got the dragon doll, it felt like I finally had my own little piece of the fantasy world.</p> <p>The dragon doll itself was quite special. It had a vibrant green color, with golden wings that shimmered when the light hit them. The body was soft and plush, but the wings and tail had a slightly stiffer texture, which made them stand out. It also had bright, sparkling eyes that gave it a very lifelike appearance, almost as though it could come to life at any moment. I used to spend hours playing with it, imagining all sorts of adventures where my dragon would fly through the skies and protect me from imaginary villains\uff08\u574f\u4eba\uff09.</p> <p>What made this toy even more memorable for me was the sense of wonder and creativity it sparked. I didn't just play with it as a regular doll. I created entire worlds and stories around it, and it became a companion during many of my childhood games. It helped me develop my imagination and storytelling skills, as I would invent elaborate scenarios and scenarios involving my dragon. It also made me feel like I could escape into a fantasy realm whenever I wanted, which was something I really valued as a child.</p> <p>Though I've grown up now and no longer play with the doll, I still keep it tucked away in a box as a reminder of my childhood and the magical adventures I had with it. It's not just a toy to me anymore; it's a symbol of the creativity and imagination that shaped a lot of my early years. It helped me dream big and created a sense of magic in my everyday life, which is something I will always treasure.</p> <p>1. How do advertisements influence children? Advertisements influence children by shaping their preferences, desires, and even behaviors. For example, ads for toys, snacks, or games often use bright colors, catchy jingles, and popular characters to grab children's attention. This can lead to children pestering their parents to buy the advertised products. Additionally, advertisements can create unrealistic expectations or promote materialism, making children believe they need certain items to be happy or fit in with their peers. Over time, this can affect their values and spending habits as they grow older.</p> <p>2. Should advertising aimed at kids be prohibited? I believe advertising aimed at kids should be regulated, if not entirely prohibited. Children are highly impressionable and may not have the critical thinking skills to understand the persuasive intent behind ads. This can lead to unhealthy consumption patterns, such as demanding sugary snacks or expensive toys. However, instead of a complete ban, stricter guidelines could be implemented to ensure ads promote positive messages, such as education or healthy habits. This way, children are protected without completely eliminating advertising.</p> <p>3. Do you think parents should buy more toys for their kids or spend more time with them? I think spending more time with children is far more important than buying them toys. While toys can be entertaining and educational, they cannot replace the emotional connection and guidance that come from quality time with parents. Playing, talking, or engaging in activities together helps children develop social skills, confidence, and a sense of security. Toys might keep children occupied temporarily, but the memories and lessons from time spent with parents have a lasting impact on their development.</p> <p>4. What's the difference between the toys kids play now and those they played in the past? The main difference between modern toys and those from the past is the level of technology and interactivity. Today's toys often include electronic components, such as lights, sounds, or apps, which make them more engaging but also more complex. In the past, toys were simpler and often made from natural materials like wood or fabric. They encouraged imaginative play and creativity, such as building blocks or dolls. While modern toys can be educational, they sometimes rely too much on pre-programmed features, leaving less room for creativity.</p> <p>5. What's the difference between the toys boys play with and girls play with? Traditionally, toys for boys and girls have been divided along gender lines, with boys encouraged to play with action figures, cars, or construction sets, while girls are given dolls, kitchen sets, or dress-up kits. These differences often reflect societal stereotypes about gender roles. However, this trend is gradually changing as more parents and educators encourage children to play with a variety of toys, regardless of gender. This shift helps children develop a wider range of skills and interests, breaking away from outdated norms.</p> <p>6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of modern toys? Modern toys have several advantages, such as being more interactive and educational. Many toys are designed to teach children coding, problem-solving, or other skills through games and activities. They also often feature advanced technology, like augmented reality, which can make learning fun and engaging. However, there are disadvantages too. Modern toys can be expensive and may require batteries or screens, which can limit imaginative play. Additionally, some toys may overstimulate children or discourage physical activity, leading to concerns about health and creativity.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#3","title":"\uff083\uff09\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u90bb\u5c45","text":"<p>Describe a neighbor you are interested in</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>Who he/she is</p> <p>How do you knew him/her</p> <p>What you do together</p> <p>And explain why he/she is interesting</p> <p>I'd like to talk about an interesting neighbor of mine, Mrs. Li, who has been living next door for several years now. She's in her late seventies, but still very active and lively, which makes her stand out in the neighborhood. I first got to know her better when my family moved here, and we immediately became friends because of her warm and welcoming nature.</p> <p>Mrs. Li is an incredibly fascinating person. Despite her age, she's traveled to more than 40 countries and has a wealth of stories to share. She's a retired professional travel writer, and over the years, she's written a number of books and articles about her adventures, which is something I find really impressive. What's even more amazing is how humble she is about it. Unlike many people who might brag about such accomplishments, Mrs. Li is very down-to-earth. She's always willing to listen to others and seems genuinely interested in hearing about what's going on in my life, too.</p> <p>One of the things that really makes Mrs. Li stand out is her love of sharing her travel experiences. When we get the chance to chat, I can listen to her for hours. She's a fantastic storyteller, and I'm always captivated by the way she describes the different cultures, people, and places she's visited. She's not only well-traveled but also very knowledgeable, so when she speaks about her experiences, I always feel like I'm learning something new and valuable. I really admire her curiosity about the world and her open-minded approach to life.</p> <p>Interestingly, we also share a lot of common interests. We both love painting, especially watercolor, and we often spend time together working on our paintings. I think it's great to have a neighbor who has similar hobbies, as it makes it easier to connect and share ideas. Additionally, Mrs. Li is very into yoga, and though I'm not as experienced as she is, she's always encouraging me to try new poses or attend local classes.</p> <p>What I truly appreciate about Mrs. Li, though, is how non-pretentious she is. It's rare to meet someone with so much life experience who remains so humble and unassuming. She never makes conversations about herself, which is refreshing because sometimes people who have done a lot in life can become a bit arrogant or self-centered. But Mrs. Li is always interested in what I have to say and makes me feel heard.</p> <p>In short, she's an inspiring, thoughtful, and kind person, and I feel really fortunate to have her as a neighbor. Our chats are something I look forward to, and I'm always learning from her, whether it's about life, travel, or art.</p> <ol> <li>Do you think people are familiar with their neighbors?</li> <li>How can people improve the relationship with neighbors in a community?</li> <li>How do children build relationships with others in community?</li> <li>Is it beneficial to get along well with neighbors?</li> <li>Why do many people in big cities not know their neighbors?</li> <li>How do people build relationships with local people in a new place?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#4_1","title":"\uff084\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b","text":"<p>Describe something you do that can help you concentrate on work/study</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>What it is</p> <p>How it helps you concentrate</p> <p>When you do it</p> <p>And explain how you feel about it</p> <p>I'd like to talk about a technique that has really helped me stay focused during my studies, and that's using the Pomodoro Technique. It might sound simple, but it has had a huge impact on my productivity. Essentially, this method involves breaking down my study time into 25-minute intervals, known as 'Pomodoros', followed by a short 5-minute break. After four cycles, I take a longer break, usually around 15 to 20 minutes.</p> <p>I discovered this technique a couple of years ago when I was struggling to stay concentrated while preparing for a major exam. I noticed that whenever I tried to study for long hours without breaks, my mind would start wandering, and I would become easily distracted. However, once I started using the Pomodoro Technique, it was like a game-changer for me. Knowing that I only have to focus for 25 minutes at a time makes the task seem more manageable, and the short breaks help me recharge mentally.</p> <p>What I find particularly effective about this method is that it helps me maintain a high level of focus during those short bursts of time. I often turn off my phone and eliminate any distractions during each session. Surprisingly, I can accomplish much more in those concentrated intervals than when I try to study for hours on end without a clear structure. The breaks also prevent me from feeling burnt out, allowing me to sustain my energy levels throughout the day.</p> <p>Besides, the Pomodoro Technique helps me stay motivated because it adds a sense of urgency. I try to challenge myself to complete a specific task before the timer runs out, which keeps me engaged. Additionally, after a few cycles, I reward myself with something small, like a cup of coffee or some snacks, which helps me stay refreshed and ready to continue.</p> <p>In conclusion, this simple yet effective technique has greatly improved my ability to concentrate and manage my time efficiently. It's definitely something I would recommend to anyone struggling to stay focused, whether it's for studying or even working on other projects.</p> <ol> <li>Why is it more difficult for children to concentrate nowadays than in the past?</li> <li>Do you think technology will harm children's ability to concentrate?</li> <li>What kinds of jobs require high concentration at work?</li> <li>Can exercise help people improve concentration?</li> <li>Is it important for children to concentrate on their studies? why?</li> <li>What can people do to improve their ability to concentrate?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#5_1","title":"\uff085\uff09\u91cd\u8981\u6e56\u6cca/\u6cb3\u6d41","text":"<p>Describe an important river/lake in your country</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>Where it is located</p> <p>How big/long it is</p> <p>What it looks like</p> <p>And explain why it is important</p> <p>I\u2019d like to talk about the Yangtze River, which is one of the most important rivers in my country, China.

As it moves eastward, it passes through lush plains, bustling cities, and fertile farmlands. The river itself is wide and powerful, especially in the middle and lower sections, where it carries a huge volume of water. One of the most famous parts of the river is the Three Gorges, a stunning area with towering cliffs and dramatic views.</p> <p>The Yangtze River is not just a natural wonder\u2014it\u2019s also a lifeline for millions of people. Historically and culturally, it has played a central role in Chinese civilization, often referred to as the \u201cMother River.\u201d Many ancient cities and cultural sites are located along its banks, making it a symbol of China\u2019s rich heritage.</p> <p>Economically, the river is vital. It supports the livelihoods of people through agriculture, fishing, and transportation. The Yangtze River Basin is one of the most productive regions in China, contributing significantly to the country\u2019s economy.

It\u2019s a type of zither with a long history, dating back over 2,500 years. The Gu Zheng is a long, wooden instrument with 21 strings, and it\u2019s played by plucking the strings using fingers, often with the help of finger picks made of plastic or tortoiseshell.</p> <p>One of the things I love about the Gu Zheng is its unique sound.

It requires a lot of precision and control, especially when using techniques like vibrato and glissando to express different moods.

I also admire how he interacts with his fans; for example, he often responds to comments and occasionally holds live-streaming sessions where he chats with his followers, which helps him build a closer relationship with his audience.</p> <p>Apart from his music, Zhou Shen is also quite involved in charitable activities, and he uses his platform to raise awareness about important social issues. On his social media, he often posts about his involvement in fundraising campaigns, environmental causes, and other initiatives to help those in need. I really appreciate that he doesn\u2019t just use his fame for personal gain, but also for the greater good, which makes me respect him even more.</p> <p>Overall, Zhou Shen is not just a talented musician but also a positive and inspiring figure on social media. His genuine personality, his dedication to his craft, and his social responsibility are some of the reasons why I follow him closely.</p> <ol> <li>What can people do on social media?</li> <li>Do older people and younger people use the same kinds of social media apps?</li> <li>Do older people spend much time on social media?</li> <li>Are non-social media like television and newspapers still useful?</li> <li>Do you think people will read paper newspapers and books in the future?

This is a time-management method that involves working in focused bursts of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four \u2018Pomodoros' , you take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. I first came across the Pomodoro Technique during university when I was struggling to balance studying with other commitments.</p> <p>Before I started using it, I would often find myself procrastinating or working inefficiently for long hours without getting much done. The Pomodoro Technique has completely transformed the way I approach tasks. It breaks down the work into manageable chunks, so I never feel overwhelmed, and the short breaks allow me to recharge before diving back into the task.</p> <p>One of the major advantages is that it helps me stay highly focused. Knowing that I only need to work for a short, set period means that I'm less likely to get distracted or lose motivation. I find that I'm able to maintain a higher level of concentration compared to when I try to work for several hours straight. Over time, I've found that I'm able to complete tasks much faster, without compromising the quality of my work.</p> <p>In addition, the Pomodoro Technique also encourages me to be more mindful about how I use my time. Because I have these short breaks, I've become more conscious of my productivity patterns and can adjust my workflow if I feel I'm not being as efficient as I could be. Overall, adopting the Pomodoro Technique has saved me a lot of time by helping me work more effectively, stay organized, and reduce burnout.  </p> <ol> <li>What can people do to save time?</li> <li>Does technology help people save time?

This event is something I look forward to every year because it's a unique combination of welcoming the new year and celebrating the vibrancy of student life.</p> <p>The celebration is truly a full-day affair, packed with a variety of activities. The day began with a student parade in the morning. It was incredible to watch the students marching in colorful costumes, holding banners, and showcasing different performances representing various clubs and departments. The parade had a lively and festive atmosphere, and you could feel the energy and excitement in the air. Everyone was cheering, taking photos, and soaking in the festive spirit.</p> <p>In the afternoon, the campus was bustling with small games and competitions organized by different student organizations. I participated in a few games with my friends, like tug-of-war and a trivia quiz, which was a lot of fun. These activities brought everyone together, and it was a great way to bond with classmates and even make new friends. I especially enjoyed the friendly, competitive spirit that filled the air.</p> <p>However, the highlight of the day was definitely the party performances held on the playground in the evening. As night fell, the entire campus was lit up with fairy lights and decorations, creating a magical ambiance. There were performances by student bands, dance groups, and even some comedy sketches, which had everyone laughing and clapping. Additionally, there was a campfire activity where all the students gathered around the flames, dancing and enjoying each other's company under the night sky.</p> <p>What made this event so special was not just the celebration itself but also the feeling of togetherness. It was the perfect way to wrap up the year and welcome a new one surrounded by friends, laughter, and a sense of community. I felt genuinely happy and grateful to be a part of such a lively and positive environment.</p> <p>This celebration will always hold a special place in my heart because it reminded me of the joy of being in college, surrounded by people who are not just classmates but a second family.

This technology has really transformed how I handle my finances and go about my daily activities. It includes various platforms like mobile banking apps, digital wallets, and payment systems like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and others. I first started using online payments a few years ago, and it's made my life so much easier and more efficient. In the past, whenever I needed to pay bills or make purchases, I had to visit physical stores or banks, which was time-consuming, especially with long queues. Now, I can pay for almost anything with just a few taps on my phone. Whether it's paying for groceries, ordering food delivery, or booking a taxi, I can do it instantly without needing cash or even a physical card. Also, these systems are highly secure, with encryption and two-factor authentication, so I don't worry much about fraud. Another thing I appreciate about online payments is how they make traveling simpler. I don't have to carry large amounts of cash when I'm in a foreign country. I can just use my phone to pay for things, which is really helpful and reduces the hassle of currency exchange. Overall, I would say online payments have made my life more convenient, efficient, and secure. It's hard to imagine going back to the old days when I had to withdraw cash from ATMs or write checks. This invention has definitely become an indispensable part of my everyday life, and I believe it's something that more people will continue to rely on in the future.</p> <p>1. What qualities do inventors have? Inventors typically possess qualities like creativity, curiosity, and perseverance. They are able to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to problems. Curiosity drives them to explore new ideas and ask questions that others might overlook. Additionally, perseverance is crucial because the invention process often involves trial and error, failures, and setbacks. Inventors also need strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently or collaboratively, depending on the project.</p> <p>2. Do all inventions bring benefits to our world? Not all inventions bring benefits; some can have negative consequences or unintended side effects. For example, while inventions like plastic have revolutionized industries, they have also led to environmental pollution. Similarly, advancements in technology, such as social media, have connected people globally but have also contributed to issues like misinformation and mental health problems. It\u2019s important to evaluate the long-term impact of inventions to ensure they contribute positively to society.</p> <p>3. Who should support and sponsor inventors, governments or private companies? Both governments and private companies have roles to play in supporting inventors. Governments can provide funding, grants, and policies that encourage innovation, especially in areas that may not be immediately profitable but are socially beneficial, such as healthcare or environmental sustainability. Private companies, on the other hand, can offer resources, expertise, and market access to bring inventions to life. A collaborative approach, where both sectors work together, can create an environment that fosters innovation and ensures its benefits are widely shared.</p> <p>4. What inventions do you think should be improved? An area for improvement is plastic materials. While plastic is versatile and durable, its non-biodegradable nature has led to environmental crises. Developing eco-friendly alternatives or better recycling methods is essential.</p> <p>5. Do you think only scientists can invent new things? No, I don\u2019t think only scientists can invent new things. While scientists often play a key role in technological and medical advancements, inventors come from all walks of life. For example, entrepreneurs, engineers, artists, and even everyday individuals can come up with innovative ideas or solutions to problems. Many inventions arise from practical needs or creative thinking rather than formal scientific research. Collaboration across different fields and perspectives often leads to the most groundbreaking innovations.</p> <p>6. Are there any other inventions that make the world better? Yes, there are countless inventions that have made the world better. For instance, the internet has revolutionized communication, education, and access to information, connecting people across the globe. Medical inventions like vaccines and antibiotics have saved millions of lives and improved public health. Renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, are helping to combat climate change by providing cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. These inventions demonstrate how creativity and innovation can address global challenges and improve quality of life.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#15_1","title":"\uff0815\uff09\u4e00\u6b21\u975e\u5e38\u5fd9\u788c\u7684\u7ecf\u5386","text":"<p>Describe a time you were very busy</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>When it happened</p> <p>Where you were</p> <p>What you did</p> <p>And explain why you were busy</p> <p>I'd like to talk about a time when I was extremely busy, which happened during the exams week in college last semester. It was one of the most stressful periods I've ever experienced because I had to prepare for nine exams, and I only had a week to do it. To be honest, I got myself into that situation because I had procrastinated on my review schedule and left everything until the last minute.</p> <p>At the start of that week, I realized how much I needed to catch up on. Each subject required intensive preparation, and the topics were quite challenging. I was overwhelmed, but there was no time to waste, so I quickly created a strict study plan. I divided my time into blocks, dedicating several hours each day to each subject, and even sacrificed sleep to make more time for studying. There were days when I was up until 3 or 4 in the morning, only to wake up a few hours later and continue revising.</p> <p>To make things even more stressful, all the exams were back-to-back with no breaks in between. I remember one particular day when I had two exams, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. As soon as I finished the first exam, I rushed to the library to cram for the next one. I had to juggle multiple textbooks, class notes, and online resources, trying to digest as much information as possible in a short time.</p> <p>What made it even more difficult was that each subject required a different approach. For subjects like mathematics and physics, I had to focus on solving practice problems, while for literature and politics, I had to memorize facts and analyze texts. I was mentally exhausted, but I kept pushing through because I knew I didn't have any other option.</p> <p>In the end, it was an exhausting week, but it paid off. I managed to get through all nine exams, and although I didn't get perfect scores, I was able to pass them all with decent grades. The experience taught me a valuable lesson about time management and the importance of starting my preparation early. I realized that the stress and sleepless nights could have been avoided if I had been more disciplined with my study schedule from the beginning. </p> <ol> <li>Are you often busy? </li> </ol> <p>1. What are the advantages and disadvantages when people keep busy? Keeping busy has several advantages, such as increasing productivity, reducing boredom, and providing a sense of purpose. When people are occupied with meaningful tasks, they often feel more accomplished and motivated. However, there are also disadvantages. Being too busy can lead to stress, burnout, and a lack of work-life balance. It may also leave little time for relaxation, self-care, or spending time with loved ones. Therefore, it\u2019s important to find a balance between staying busy and allowing time for rest.</p> <p>2. Do you think children should learn through playing games or under pressure? I believe children learn best through playing games rather than under pressure. Games make learning fun and engaging, which helps children retain information and develop skills like problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork. For example, educational games can teach math, language, or science concepts in an interactive way. On the other hand, learning under pressure can lead to anxiety, fear of failure, and a negative attitude toward education. A balanced approach, where play is combined with gentle guidance, is ideal for fostering a love of learning.</p> <p>3. What kind of pressure do people may experience at work? People may experience various types of pressure at work, such as meeting tight deadlines, handling heavy workloads, or dealing with high expectations from supervisors. They might also face pressure to perform well, compete with colleagues, or adapt to changes in the workplace. Additionally, interpersonal conflicts or a lack of work-life balance can contribute to stress. These pressures can affect mental and physical health, making it important for employers to create a supportive and manageable work environment.</p> <p>4. How does technology help with time management? Technology helps with time management by providing tools and apps that organize tasks, set reminders, and track progress. For example, calendar apps allow users to schedule appointments and prioritize activities, while project management software helps teams collaborate and meet deadlines efficiently. Additionally, automation tools can handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for more important activities. Technology also enables remote work, reducing time spent commuting and allowing for more flexible schedules. Overall, it enhances productivity and helps people make the most of their time.</p> <p>5. Does technology distract people? Yes, technology can be a significant source of distraction. For instance, social media, entertainment apps, and notifications often interrupt focus and reduce productivity. Many people find it challenging to resist the temptation to check their phones or browse the internet, especially when working or studying. However, technology can also be used to minimize distractions through features like \u201cdo not disturb\u201d modes or apps that block access to distracting sites. The key is to use technology mindfully and set boundaries to stay focused.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#16_1","title":"\uff0816\uff09\u60ca\u559c\u4e4b\u4e8b","text":"<p>Describe something that surprised you and made you happy</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>What it was</p> <p>Who did this</p> <p>How you found out about it and what you did</p> <p>And explain why it surprised you and made you happy</p> <p>One of the most surprising and happiest moments I've experienced was when I received a birthday cake from my boyfriend at the time.

We've known each other for about 3 years now, ever since we met in university, and over time, she's become one of the people I cherish the most in my life. Whenever I need someone to talk to, whether it's about something serious or just a lighthearted chat, Anna is always my go-to person. One of the main reasons I enjoy talking to her is because she's such an attentive listener. No matter what I'm talking about, she always gives me her full attention, which is quite rare these days when people are often distracted by their phones. She doesn't just listen passively either\u2014she asks thoughtful questions and offers insightful advice. For example, there was a time when I was really struggling with making an academic decision, and she helped me weigh the pros and cons without being pushy or judgmental. Her ability to understand my perspective and give me advice that's actually helpful is something I truly appreciate. Another reason I love our conversations is because we share similar interests, especially when it comes to books, movies, and current events. We often end up having deep discussions about the latest book we've read or a thought-provoking documentary we've watched. These conversations can sometimes last for hours, but it never feels like a waste of time because I always come away feeling inspired or having learned something new. What I admire most about Anna is her sense of humor. Even when we're talking about serious topics, she has this amazing ability to make me laugh. It's not that she makes light of serious matters, but rather, she knows how to add a touch of humor that lightens the mood. This is especially comforting when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed\u2014she just has a way of turning my day around with her jokes and witty comments. All in all, talking to Anna is something I genuinely look forward to because it's not only enjoyable but also meaningful. I always feel understood, supported, and uplifted after our conversations. It's a rare thing to have someone in your life with whom you can talk about almost anything, and I consider myself lucky to have a friend like her.</p> <ol> <li>Where do young people like to meet?</li> <li>What do young people talk about when they meet up?</li> <li>Do you think people should be honest when talking with friends?</li> <li>On what occasions do people talk with strangers?</li> <li>What makes a good listener?</li> <li>What are the differences between talking to a friend and talking to a stranger?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#18_1","title":"\uff0818\uff09\u4f60\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u540d\u4eba","text":"<p>Describe a popular/well-known person in your country</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>Who this person is</p> <p>What he/she has done</p> <p>Why he/she is popular</p> <p>And explain how you feel about this person</p> <p>I'd like to talk about Sun Yingsha, who is one of the most well-known athletes in China today.

Sun Yingsha has become a household name in China, not just because of her exceptional skills, but also because of her dedication, sportsmanship, and relentless pursuit of excellence. At the Paris Olympics, Sun Yingsha had a remarkable run. She won several medals, among which the mixed doubles gold was particularly significant because it was the first-ever mixed doubles gold medal for the Chinese table tennis team.  What really impresses me about Sun Yingsha is her determination and focus on the game.(She's known for her incredible agility, quick reflexes, and powerful shots.) Watching her play is truly inspiring because she always gives it her all, whether it's a national competition or the Olympic finals. Despite being under immense pressure, she maintains a calm demeanor, which is something I really admire. Beyond her skills on the table, Sun Yingsha is also admired for her humility. Despite her numerous achievements, she remains grounded and always credits her teammates and coaches for her success. This attitude has won her a lot of fans, not just in China but around the world.  Her popularity in China goes beyond just sports enthusiasts. She has become a symbol of perseverance and excellence, especially for the younger generation. Many young athletes look up to her as a role model because she shows that with hard work, anything is possible.  All in all, Sun Yingsha is a true sports icon in China.

She's not only a family member but also someone I deeply admire and look up to. My cousin has always been an incredibly organized and creative person, and over the years, I've seen her develop these skills into something truly professional. Currently, she works as a graphic designer for a well-known agency, and I've always been fascinated by her work. The reason I would like to work with her is that we both share a passion for creative projects. I have some skills in building website and content creation, so I think we would complement each other quite well if we started a business together. For instance, I imagine we could run a small design and marketing firm, where she could handle the visual elements, while I focus on managing social media, and marketing strategies. It's something we've casually discussed a few times, and I believe our combined skills would make for a solid partnership. Moreover, my cousin is someone who is extremely disciplined and has a strong work ethic, which I think would be a great influence on me. She's always been the kind of person who plans things meticulously, whether it's a project deadline or even a family event. This kind of structured approach to work is something I could definitely learn from. On the other hand, I'm a bit more spontaneous and flexible, so I think we would balance each other out quite well. Another reason I'd love to collaborate with her is that working with a family member, especially someone I'm close to, would make the experience more enjoyable. I imagine it would create a sense of trust and openness, which can be hard to find when working with colleagues you don't know as well. Of course, there could be challenges, such as mixing family and business, but I think our strong communication skills would help us overcome any potential conflicts.

Working with family members can be both beneficial and challenging. On the positive side, it fosters trust, loyalty, and open communication, as family members often share common goals and values. For example, a family-run business can operate more harmoniously because everyone is invested in its success. However, it can also lead to conflicts, as personal and professional boundaries may blur. Disagreements over decisions or responsibilities can strain relationships. Overall, it depends on the family dynamics and the ability to maintain professionalism.</p> <p>3. Why do people want to do family business? People are drawn to family businesses for several reasons.

Why do people want to change their jobs? People change jobs for various reasons, including seeking better career opportunities, higher salaries, or improved work-life balance. Some may feel stagnant in their current roles and look for new challenges to grow professionally. Others might leave due to dissatisfaction with their workplace environment, such as poor management or lack of recognition. Personal reasons, like relocating to a new city or pursuing a passion, can also drive job changes. Ultimately, people want to find roles that align with their goals, values, and lifestyle.</p> <p>6.

The walk was about 10 kilometers, and we had to march from our school to an outdoor tourist attraction called the Oriental Oasis, which is a well-known park and scenic area.</p> <p>The walk itself was part of a larger training activity, so we had to follow a strict schedule and walk in formation with a large group of fellow students. I remember the morning we set off \u2013 it was very early, and the air was cool and fresh. At first, it seemed manageable. But later, as we walked further from the school and into the countryside, the distance started to feel longer and the landscape began to change.</p> <p>The route wasn't particularly difficult, but the challenge was maintaining a steady pace. Such a long walk was very demanding physically, and after a while, my legs started to feel sore. However, there was a sense of camaraderie among my classmates, and we encouraged each other to keep going. We would sing songs or share jokes from time to time to distract ourselves from the exhaustion, and that definitely helped keep our spirits up.</p> <p>When we finally reached the Oriental Oasis, it felt like a huge accomplishment. No one straggled. The sense of relief was overwhelming, and we were able to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. </p> <p>In retrospect, that 10-kilometer walk was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life. It taught me a lot about physical endurance, teamwork, and the importance of perseverance. Even though it was tough at times, I'm glad I had the chance to do it, as it not only built my stamina but also gave me a sense of achievement that I still carry with me today.</p> <ol> <li>What outdoor activities do people like?</li> <li>What are the differences between the outdoor activities children did in the past and now?</li> <li>Is leisure time important to everyone?

It\u2019s not just a place to jot down my thoughts; it\u2019s a tool for organizing my life, processing emotions, and even setting goals.</p> <p>I use my notebook for a variety of purposes. One of the most important things I do with it is to have conversations with myself. I write down my thoughts, reflect on my day, and track my progress over time. This practice feels like a form of self-therapy, as it helps me process my emotions and gain clarity about my feelings. For example, when I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed, writing everything down helps me break things into smaller, manageable steps, which instantly reduces my stress.</p> <p>In addition to its emotional benefits, my notebook is invaluable for its practicality. I use it to brainstorm new ideas, draft plans for upcoming events, or list things I need to accomplish. The physical act of writing helps me transform vague thoughts into concrete actions, which is something I find much more satisfying than typing on a phone or computer. While apps can be convenient, they don\u2019t give me the same sense of connection and focus that writing on paper does.</p> <p>What makes my notebook so essential is that it\u2019s more than just a tool\u2014it\u2019s a companion that helps me stay grounded, creative, and reflective. It\u2019s a space where I can be completely honest with myself, whether I\u2019m setting goals, working through challenges, or simply capturing moments of inspiration. Without it, I\u2019d feel disorganized and disconnected from my own thoughts.</p> <p>In short, my notebook is something I can\u2019t live without because it plays such a central role in both my emotional well-being and my daily productivity.

I started doing this a few years ago, as I felt that my reading and writing skills were improving, but my listening and speaking abilities were still not at the level I wanted.</p> <p>At first, I watched with subtitles in Chinese to understand the context and storyline, but gradually, I switched to English subtitles. This helped me connect the spoken words with their written form, and it also allowed me to learn new vocabulary and expressions. The great thing about watching movies and TV shows is that they expose you to various accents and colloquial\uff08\u53e3\u8bed\u7684\uff09 language, which is often not covered in traditional language lessons.</p> <p>I chose to watch a variety of genres, from dramas to comedies, and even documentaries. I wanted to get used to different tones, speeds of speaking, and formal versus informal language. For example, I watched 2 Broke Girls. They use everyday, conversational English, which helped me sound more natural in casual conversations. Additionally, watching documentaries or news programs helped me improve my formal language and understanding of more complex vocabulary.</p> <p>Another benefit of this approach was that it made learning English more enjoyable. Instead of seeing it as a task, I started to look forward to the next episode or movie, and without realizing it, I was learning new phrases and improving my listening skills. It also gave me a better understanding of culture and the way people interact in different contexts, which I think is crucial for mastering any language.</p> <p>Overall, watching TV shows and movies in English was a fun and effective way for me to enhance my language skills. It allowed me to practice listening, pick up new words, and become more familiar with English-speaking cultures, all while keeping my learning process engaging.</p> <ol> <li>What difficulties do people face when learning a language?</li> <li>Do you think language learning is important?

My grandma has been knitting for as long as I can remember, and she's always crafted beautiful, intricate pieces for her family. When I opened the package and saw the sweater, I was immediately struck by the craftsmanship.

It no longer fits me as it once did, which is a bit bittersweet. Still, I can't bring myself to part with it because it holds so many memories.

So, this dog park is located in the city suburbs. It was just built a few months ago, and it's been a hit\uff08\u6f6e\u6d41\uff09 from day one\uff08\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u5929\u8d77\uff09. It's become a local sensation\uff08\u5f53\u5730\u7684\u6f6e\u6d41\uff09 for not just dog owners\uff08\u72d7\u4e3b\u4eba\uff09, but also dog lovers\uff08\u7231\u72d7\u4eba\u58eb\uff09.

I can't tell you how much this dog park has changed my life. There're so many things we can do in this park. We can walk our dogs on the winding walking trails\uff08\u873f\u8712\u7684\u6b65\u884c\u5c0f\u8def\uff09. Or we can just let them run around in the open areas\uff08\u5f00\u573a\u5730\u5e26\uff09. And there are benches and picnic spots\uff08\u957f\u6905\u957f\u51f3\u548c\u91ce\u9910\u5730\u70b9\uff09 for the owners, so it's not just fun for the dogs. It's a nice hangout spot\uff08\u805a\u70b9\uff09 for us too.</p> <p>And then, I love the impacts of this new park. It brings dog owners together\uff08\u628a\u4eba\u5e26\u5230\u4e00\u8d77\uff09, creating a sense of community. It's like a social hub where people meet, chat, and share their dog-raising experiences\uff08\u5206\u4eab\u517b\u72d7\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff09. It's also beneficial for people who don't like dogs or even are afraid of dogs, because this dog park keeps dogs off the streets\uff08\u8ba9\u72d7\u72d7\u8fdc\u79bb\u5927\u8857\uff09, giving those dogs, especially bigger ones, a specific place to be.

After the breakup, in the beginning, he was still trying to influence my decision by constantly calling me and trying to see me. It was extremely difficult for me to not pick up the phone. But I pulled myself together\uff08\u632f\u4f5c\u8d77\u6765\uff09. I didn't give him any chances to talk to me. And eventually, after 6 months, he gave up. I'm now feeling so much better without him.

It happened last year when she was really struggling in her relationship and was torn about whether to break up with her boyfriend or not. She asked me for my honest opinion, and after hearing her out, I suggested that she end the relationship.</p> <p>My friend had been with her boyfriend for nearly three years, but during that time, she often felt conflicted. On one hand, she told me he was funny, charming, and could always make her laugh. She appreciated his sense of humor and charisma, which had initially drawn her to him. But on the other hand, she described him as controlling and overly domineering. He constantly wanted things to go his way and pressured her to always agree with him. It was clear that he was quite bossy and had a very macho attitude.</p> <p>As my friend shared all this with me, she was obviously distressed. She explained that she felt suffocated in the relationship because he expected her to follow his commands, which didn't align with her independent nature. I could see how this was affecting her mental and emotional well-being. She was hesitant about making a decision because they had been together for so long, and she felt that ending things might be too drastic. But at the same time, she was unhappy and didn't feel like she could truly be herself around him.</p> <p>After listening to her, I told her that if the relationship was making her miserable, it was probably better for her to walk away. I reminded her that staying in a relationship out of fear of being alone is never a good reason. She needed to prioritize her own happiness and mental health. Although it was a tough suggestion to make, I believed it was the right call.</p> <p>In the end, she decided to take my advice and broke up with him. The breakup was really hard on her at first because her ex-boyfriend kept trying to reach out, calling her and asking to meet. I remember she had a hard time resisting the urge to answer his calls, but she stayed strong and eventually cut off all communication. After several months, he finally stopped contacting her, and she began to heal.</p> <p>Now, she often tells me how grateful she is for my advice. She feels much lighter and happier without the constant stress he brought into her life. While it wasn't easy for her to go through, she now realizes it was the right thing to do.

This happened on my university campus, and it involved bikes rather than cars. Since I'm a student, I commute to different classes on my electric bike every day because our campus is quite large. There's a long break between classes, and during this time, many students, including myself, need to move between buildings. Unfortunately, this often leads to a chaotic situation.</p> <p>The main issue is that there's only one main road connecting the east and west sides of the campus, and it's the shortest route. Taking any other path would be three times longer, so naturally, everyone prefers using this route. One day, I had a class in a building on the west side, and I had just finished a class in the east. The teacher delayed the class for 5 minutes, so as soon as the class was over, I jumped on my bike and headed towards the other building.</p> <p>However, as soon as I reached the main road, I found myself stuck in a bike traffic jam. There were dozens, if not hundreds, of students on electric bikes, all trying to use the same road at the same time. The university guard was trying to manage the flow, but many students were impatient and didn't listen to his instructions. This only made the situation worse, as everyone was trying to squeeze through, making the road even more congested.</p> <p>I was frustrated because I knew I was running late. At one point, we were all at a standstill, unable to move forward or backward. When the traffic finally started moving again, I still had to struggle to find a parking spot near my class building. Most of the parking spaces were already full, so I ended up circling around, wasting even more time. In the end, I arrived five minutes late for my class, which was quite embarrassing.</p> <p>Looking back, it was a stressful experience, but it also taught me to plan my commute better during those peak times. Now, if I know I have back-to-back classes in different buildings, I try to leave a bit earlier to avoid getting stuck in that bike traffic jam.

I was really impressed by how skillfully she managed to maintain her balance while riding at such a slow pace, and it inspired me to give it a try myself.</p> <p>What makes this competition so intriguing to me is that it's not about speed or endurance, but rather about balance, control, and patience. The riders are required to pedal slowly and steadily, and if you stop or put your feet on the ground, you're disqualified. It's a real test of your ability to stay focused and maintain steady control of the bike, which I think is a fun and challenging way to compete.</p> <p>I believe I would be able to do well in this competition because I have a good sense of balance.

Back then, I was under a lot of pressure to perform well academically, and I often found myself feeling overwhelmed and distracted whenever I tried to study. So, I decided to visit the school's counseling office to seek some guidance.</p> <p>When I explained my situation to the counselor, I told her that my biggest struggle was maintaining concentration. I would often start studying with good intentions, but within minutes, my mind would wander off, and I'd end up procrastinating or getting distracted by my phone. That's when she suggested a technique called the Pomodoro Technique, which was something I had never heard of before.</p> <p>The Pomodoro Technique involves breaking your study time into 25-minute intervals, called \"pomodoros,\" followed by a short 5-minute break. After completing four of these intervals, you can take a longer break of about 15 to 30 minutes. The counselor explained that this method helps improve focus and productivity by giving the brain regular breaks, which prevents burnout and keeps you refreshed. She advised me to try it out, especially since I was struggling with staying on task for long periods.</p> <p>I decided to follow her advice, and to my surprise, it made a significant difference. I started using a timer on my phone to break my study sessions into 25-minute chunks, and I noticed that my concentration improved dramatically. Knowing that a break was coming made it easier to stay focused during each interval. I also felt less stressed because instead of trying to force myself to study for hours on end, I was working in manageable bursts. It made my study sessions much more efficient and even enjoyable.</p> <p>What I appreciated most about this advice was that it was practical and easy to implement, yet it had a profound impact on my productivity. This simple technique helped me manage my study stress better and made a noticeable difference in my performance. To this day, I still use the Pomodoro Technique whenever I need to focus on a challenging task, and I'm grateful to that counselor for introducing me to it.</p> <p>Overall, this experience taught me that sometimes, the right advice can completely change the way you approach your studies. The Pomodoro Technique was a game-changer for me, and it's something that continues to benefit me even now.</p> <ol> <li>When should parents encourage their children?</li> <li>Should parents always encourage their children?</li> <li>Do you think negative feedback is more important than positive feedback?

I started this habit around a year ago when I realized I needed to improve my fitness level but didn't have the motivation to go to a gym or fitness class. The convenience of exercising at home with the guidance of a live streamer was a game-changer for me.</p> <p>The streamer I follow specializes in HIIT workouts, which stand for High-Intensity Interval Training. These sessions typically last about 30 to 45 minutes and combine cardio exercises with strength training, which helps me not only burn calories but also build muscle. What I find particularly motivating is that the streamer often interacts with viewers, offering words of encouragement and answering questions in real-time. This interactive aspect makes the experience much more engaging than simply following a pre-recorded video.</p> <p>One of the main reasons I enjoy exercising this way is that it fits easily into my schedule. I can join the live stream whenever it's convenient for me, and if I miss a session, I can always watch the recording later. Plus, the variety of workouts keeps things interesting. The streamer mixes things up by incorporating different types of exercises, like yoga stretches or core workouts, so it never feels monotonous.</p> <p>I've noticed significant benefits since I started these workouts. I've become more energetic, and my endurance has improved considerably. Additionally, it's been great for my mental health, especially when I've had a long, stressful day. Following along with someone who's both knowledgeable and enthusiastic really helps me stay consistent and motivated.</p> <p>In the future, I'd like to explore other fitness routines, but for now, following this online streamer is definitely my favorite way to stay fit.

It wasn't anything too complicated, but it was definitely a challenge at first, especially since I had never attempted any plumbing repairs before.</p> <p>One day, while I was washing dishes, I noticed that the tap was leaking, and water kept dripping even after turning it off completely. This was not only wasteful but also pretty annoying, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. At first, I thought about asking my parents to call a plumber, but then I figured it would be a good learning experience to try and fix it myself.</p> <p>The first thing I did was watch a couple of tutorial videos online to understand the basics of how a tap works and what might be causing the issue. After some research, I realized that the problem was most likely a worn-out washer inside the tap. Luckily, we had a set of basic tools and some spare washers at home.</p> <p>I turned off the water supply and carefully unscrewed the tap handle. I was a bit nervous at first, worried that I might make the problem worse, but I managed to remove the faulty washer and replace it with a new one. Once I put everything back together and turned on the water supply again, I was thrilled to see that the leak had stopped!</p> <p>Honestly, fixing the tap gave me a real sense of accomplishment. It wasn't just about saving the cost of hiring a professional, but also about gaining the confidence to handle small repairs around the house. Plus, it felt good to be able to contribute to maintaining our home, especially since I'm usually not very handy with tools.</p> <p>In conclusion, what started as a minor household inconvenience turned into a valuable learning experience.

This rule mandates that every student must meet a certain fitness standard in order to graduate, and I find it not only unreasonable but also counterproductive in some ways. First of all, the idea of having a unified fitness standard for all students is simply unrealistic. Every individual's health condition and fitness level are different, and this rule fails to take that into account. For example, I myself am not particularly good at physical activities due to issues with my respiratory system. During physical exercises, I often experience significant pain and discomfort, especially when I engage in endurance activities like running. This makes it extremely hard for me to meet the required fitness benchmarks. On the other hand, there are students who are naturally more athletic and enthusiastic about sports, and for them, this test might even feel like a fun challenge. The idea of applying the same standard to everyone is, in my opinion, unscientific and unfair. Furthermore, I believe that this physical fitness test erodes students'quality of life and freedom. University life should be about personal growth and exploration, but the pressure to meet an arbitrary fitness standard can lead to unnecessary stress. Instead of encouraging a healthy lifestyle, it often forces students into routines that may not be suitable for their individual needs. For students like me, who may have physical discomfort during strenuous activities, this rule can lead to feelings of inadequacy or even worsen their health problems. In the long run, it may also contribute to the development of negative attitudes towards fitness. The rule also seems outdated in today's world, where universities are increasingly focusing on personalized education and promoting mental well-being alongside physical health. Instead of imposing a one-size-fits-all fitness test, I believe universities should take a more individualized approach. For instance, students could be given a choice to take fitness assessments that align with their personal health conditions or interests, such as offering alternative activities like yoga, swimming, or even mental health workshops for those who struggle with physical challenges.</p> <ol> <li>What are the rules students should follow at school?</li> <li>Are the rules at school good or bad?

It is located on the eastern coast of China. Shanghai is not only one of the largest cities in the world but also one of the most vibrant and diverse. It seamlessly blends traditional Chinese culture with modern, cutting-edge development, making it a truly fascinating place to explore.</p> <p>One of the things that immediately struck me about Shanghai is its iconic skyline, especially the area known as the Bund. On one side, you have historic colonial-era buildings, and on the other, the futuristic skyscrapers of Pudong, like the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Shanghai Tower, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world. At night, the cityscape lights up with colorful displays, creating a breathtaking view.</p> <p>What I find most interesting about Shanghai is its unique blend of old and new. For instance, you can visit the ancient Yu Garden, which dates back to the Ming Dynasty, and within minutes, you can find yourself in the bustling, high-tech shopping district of Nanjing Road. It's a city where tradition and modernity coexist harmoniously, offering a rich cultural experience.</p> <p>Another thing I absolutely love about Shanghai is its diverse food scene. Whether you're sampling street food like the famous xiaolongbao, which are juicy soup dumplings, or dining at upscale restaurants, there's something for every palate. The city is also known for its vibrant nightlife, with trendy bars and rooftop lounges that offer stunning views of the cityscape.</p> <p>Personally, I find Shanghai inspiring because it's constantly evolving while still preserving its rich cultural heritage. It's a city that reflects China's rapid modernization but also honors its past. It's a place that leaves a lasting impression and makes you want to return again and again.

Gama is a curious little guy\u2014full of energy and always eager to explore. One day, my mom took him out for his usual walk around our neighborhood. As they were strolling down a street, they came across a group of three or four cats lounging in the sun.</p> <p>Now, Gama, being his usual friendly self, decided to approach them. He perked up\uff08\u632f\u594b\uff09 his little stubby tail, wiggling \u626d\u52a8 his entire backside in excitement as he tried to greet them. However, the cats, being aloof \u51b7\u6de1\u7684 as they often are, weren't too impressed with Gama's enthusiasm. According to my mom, one of the cats even gave a warning hiss. But instead of getting scared, Gama just tilted his head, almost like he was trying to figure out why they weren't as happy to see him.</p> <p>My mom was a bit nervous that the situation might escalate, but instead of attacking, the cats just stared at Gama, clearly perplexed. Eventually, one of the cats, probably the leader, cautiously approached him, gave him a quick sniff, and then walked off as if to say, \"You're not worth my time.\"</p> <p>What I found most hilarious\uff08\u6781\u5176\u6ed1\u7a3d\u7684 \uff09about this story is that Gama, despite his confident attitude, ended up looking so puzzled when the cats ignored him.

It was a gathering where I got the chance to meet a lot of new people, and this particular girl, who sat next to me, really stood out. We started talking almost immediately, and from the very first conversation, I could tell that we clicked. She was incredibly friendly, outgoing, and easy to talk to, and it felt like we were on the same wavelength. We just \u201cgot\u201d each other, and the conversation flowed effortlessly.</p> <p>What really intrigued me about her was that she was a professional traveler, and at the time, she had already traveled to over 40 different countries. She shared some of fascinating travel stories I'd ever heard. I could tell she was a great storyteller because I was completely captivated by everything she said. Her stories weren't just about the places she visited; they were filled with details about the people she met, the cultures she experienced, and the unique moments that made each trip memorable. I was absolutely engaged throughout our conversation, and I couldn't help but feel inspired by her adventures.</p> <p>I really enjoyed talking to her because, first of all, I'm someone who loves traveling too, so we had that in common. I found her experiences both exciting and educational. She was also incredibly knowledgeable about the world in general, not just travel. It was clear that she had a deep understanding of different cultures, global issues, and various ways of life. This made her very charismatic, as she didn't just talk about herself, but also shared insights and interesting facts about the world.</p> <p>What I appreciated the most about her, though, was how humble she was. Despite having traveled so much and experienced so many things, she didn't come across as pretentious or self-centered at all. It's common to meet people who have had extensive life experiences and for them to be a bit arrogant or always turn the conversation back to themselves. But she was the complete opposite. She was a great listener and was genuinely interested in what I had to say. I felt like she cared about my stories, too, and that made me admire her even more.</p> <p>Since we only met that once, I've been really curious to get to know her better. I would love to hear more about her travels and learn from her perspectives on life, as she seemed so open-minded and wise. I also think she could teach me a lot about staying humble and grounded, despite achieving so much.

It was a team-building exercise that was both fun and incredibly insightful. The highlight of this class was a game called \"Tongxin Drum,\" which translates to \"United Drum.\" This activity was designed to enhance our teamwork and collaboration skills.</p> <p>The setup was quite simple yet challenging. We were divided into groups of eight, with each person positioned at a different point around a large, circular drum. The drum was suspended in the air by eight ropes, each held by one of us. In the middle of the drum, there was a ball, and our task was to move together in perfect coordination to bounce the ball continuously without letting it fall off. The goal was to see how many times we could bounce the ball in a row.</p> <p>What impressed me the most about this class was how it forced us to work together seamlessly. At first, it seemed like a straightforward task, but it turned out to be much more challenging than we expected. Each of us had to maintain just the right amount of tension on our ropes, and even the slightest movement by one person would affect the entire drum. We quickly realized that in order to succeed, we needed to communicate clearly and synchronize our movements. It was an excellent way to understand the importance of teamwork because if even one person was out of sync, the ball would fall off almost immediately.</p> <p>This course not only improved our physical coordination but also taught us valuable lessons about collaboration and trust. I remember feeling a great sense of accomplishment when we finally managed to keep the ball bouncing for more than 30 times in a row. It required patience, quick thinking, and a lot of encouragement from each other. The experience was both fun and rewarding, and it brought us closer as a group.</p> <p>What made this class particularly memorable was how it combined physical exercise with practical life skills. It was a refreshing break from the usual sports activities, and it showed me that even something as simple as moving in sync with others can teach us a lot about teamwork, trust, and communication. To this day, I remember that lesson whenever I'm working in a group setting because it reminded me how crucial it is to listen, adapt, and support each other. </p> <ol> <li>Why do some people have a better memory than others\uff1f</li> <li>Do people like things of memorial significance?</li> <li>Which can help people remember things better, words or photos\uff1f</li> <li>Can technology help people remember things better?

She was a professional traveler\uff08\u804c\u4e1a\u65c5\u884c\u5bb6\uff09, and she had traveled to more than 40 different countries at that time. She shared with me a lot of fascinating stories.

Anna has always been someone who loves DIY projects and is incredibly crafty, so I think this would be the perfect gift for her. She enjoys hands-on activities that allow her to build or create something from scratch, and this model would definitely capture her interest.</p> <p>The chocolate factory model is a unique and intricate design. It's made from high-quality wood, and the pieces are laser-cut, which makes it very precise and easy to assemble.  The model actually has moving parts. Once completing the assembly,  we can see marbles, served as chocolate beans, roll through the structure, mimicking the process of chocolate being made in a factory. There are little gears and mechanisms that make the marbles move along a track, and when it's all put together, the factory comes to life in a fun and charming way.</p> <p>I think Anna would absolutely love this gift for several reasons. First, she enjoys working with her hands, so assembling this model would be a fun challenge for her. The fact that it's a chocolate factory theme would also appeal to her because she has a sweet tooth, and the idea of creating something that's related to chocolate is quite fitting. Secondly, I know that she appreciates gifts that are thoughtful and personalized, and this one would show that I understand her hobbies and interests.</p> <p>Moreover, this model would serve as both a relaxing activity and a decorative piece once it's completed. It's the kind of thing that she could proudly display on her shelf, and every time she looks at it, she'd remember the fun process of building it. I can imagine her spending hours working on it, and I'm sure she'd enjoy every step of the journey, from the assembly to watching the marbles roll.</p> <p>Overall, I think a DIY wooden chocolate factory assembly model would be a wonderful gift for Anna. It's not only creative and fun, but it also aligns perfectly with her interests.

Zhang is a Chinese educator and the founder of the Huaping High School for Girls, which was the first free high school exclusively for girls in China. Her dedication to education, especially for underprivileged girls in rural areas, is nothing short of extraordinary.</p> <p>Zhang Guimei has spent over two decades working tirelessly in the remote, mountainous regions of Yunnan province, where many families face economic difficulties. The area she chose to work in is incredibly impoverished, and girls there are often forced to drop out of school due to financial constraints or societal expectations. What's truly commendable about her work is that she not only focuses on providing free education but also personally visits families to persuade them to allow their daughters to attend school. In some cases, she even uses her own limited income to help pay for students' expenses.</p> <p>Her efforts have transformed countless lives. Many of her students, who would have otherwise been confined to a life of hardship, have gone on to pursue higher education and secure stable careers. Zhang's selflessness has not only empowered individual girls but also uplifted entire families and communities.</p> <p>What I find most inspiring about Zhang Guimei is her relentless commitment to social equality. Despite battling health issues, including cancer, she continues to devote her life to ensuring that girls from impoverished backgrounds have access to education. She firmly believes that education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, and her actions reflect that belief.</p> <p>In recognition of her contributions, she has received numerous national awards, including being named one of the \u201cPeople's Role Models\u201d in China. However, I think what truly sets her apart is her genuine compassion and her willingness to sacrifice her own well-being for the greater good.</p> <p>To sum up, Zhang Guimei is a true inspiration and a shining example of how one person's dedication and hard work can change society for the better. Her story reminds us that, with enough passion and determination, we can all make a positive difference in the world.</p> <ol> <li>What jobs are well-paid?</li> <li>What are the changes in working conditions?</li> <li>What are the impacts of the epidemic on the work environment?</li> <li>Do you think younger people should be lower-paid than older people?</li> <li>What skills should be taught at school to improve students'ability to find jobs?</li> <li>What kinds of jobs are not paid fairly?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#45","title":"\uff0845\uff09\u7528\u624b\u673a\u505a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e8b","text":"<p>Describe a time you used your cellphone/smartphone to do something important</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>What happened</p> <p>When it happened</p> <p>How important the cellphone/smartphone was</p> <p>And explain how you felt about the experience</p> <p>I'd like to talk about a time when I used my smartphone to do something really important. This happened just a few months ago during a offline academic lecture. It was an important session for one of my courses, and I was relying on my laptop to take notes. But, unfortunately, halfway through the lecture, my laptop suddenly ran out of battery. I hadn't realized it was so low, and I didn't have my charger with me at that moment.</p> <p>At first, I panicked because I didn't want to miss any critical information from the lecture. It was a session led by a guest lecturer, so I knew it wasn't something that would be easily repeated. That's when I decided to use my smartphone to salvage the situation. I quickly took out my phone, using the notes app to jot down key points.</p> <p>What really surprised me was how effective my phone turned out to be for taking notes. Of course, the screen was much smaller than my laptop's, but the phone's keyboard was responsive, and I was able to type relatively quickly. I even found it convenient to use voice typing for some parts, which allowed me to capture information even faster. Additionally, I could switch between apps seamlessly to check references and details the lecturer mentioned during the talk.</p> <p>In the end, I managed to take detailed notes without missing much of the lecture, which was a huge relief. I was actually proud of myself for staying calm and adapting to the situation. I realized that my phone is more than just a device for communication or entertainment; it's a powerful tool that can be incredibly useful in unexpected situations.</p> <p>After that experience, I made it a habit to keep my phone fully charged during important events, and I've even started using it more often for taking notes or accessing online resources when I'm on the go. It was a lesson in being resourceful and making the most of what I had at the moment. It might have been a small incident, but it definitely left a lasting impression on how versatile smartphones can be for academic purposes.</p> <ol> <li>What do you usually do with a cellphone?</li> <li>What are the differences between young people and old people when using a cellphone?</li> <li>Which one is more important, using a cellphone to make phone calls or to read messages?</li> <li>Do you think there should be a law to stop people from making phone calls in public?</li> <li>What can be done to stop cellphone addiction?</li> <li>Do you think it is too late to call others at 11 or 12 o'clock at night?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#46","title":"\uff0846\uff09\u5411\u957f\u8005\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6280\u80fd","text":"<p>Describe a skill that you learned from older people</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>What the skill is</p> <p>Who you learned it from</p> <p>How you learned it</p> <p>And how you feel about it</p> <p>One skill that I learned from an older person is how to make rice dumplings, which I learned from my grandmother. In my culture, rice dumplings, or \"zongzi\" as we call them, are traditionally made to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, and it's a skill that's been passed down through generations.</p> <p>I first learned this skill a few years ago when I visited my grandmother during one of my school holidays. Growing up, I had always been fascinated by how she would so effortlessly wrap the dumplings with bamboo leaves, filling them with sticky rice, red beans, and pieces of marinated meat\uff08\u814c\u8089\uff09. So, one day, I asked her to teach me how to make them, and she was more than happy to pass on her knowledge.</p> <p>The process was much more challenging than I had anticipated. First, my grandmother showed me how to soak the sticky rice overnight\uff08\u5c06\u7cef\u7c73\u6d78\u6ce1\u4e00\u591c\uff09 and prepare the fillings, making sure they were well-seasoned\uff08\u628a\u9985\u6599\u8c03\u5473\u597d\uff09. The most difficult part, though, was folding the bamboo leaves into a neat triangular shape and securing them with string. My initial attempts were clumsy; the leaves would slip, and the filling would spill out. However, my grandmother was very patient. She guided me step by step, demonstrating how to fold the leaves tightly and tie the string so that the dumplings wouldn't fall apart during boiling.</p> <p>What I really appreciated about learning this skill from my grandmother was not just mastering the technique but also hearing the stories and traditions behind it. She shared how her mother taught her, and how, back in the day, families would gather to make these dumplings together, turning it into a cherished tradition. It made me realize that making rice dumplings isn't just about the food itself, but also about family bonding and preserving cultural heritage.</p> <p>Since learning this skill, I've tried making rice dumplings on my own a few times, especially during the Dragon Boat Festival, to share with friends and family. Although I'm not nearly as skilled as my grandmother, I've definitely improved. What makes me happiest is seeing the smiles on people's faces when they taste the dumplings I've made\u2014it's a small way for me to keep our family tradition alive.</p> <p>Looking back, I'm grateful for the time I spent with my grandmother learning this skill. It's not just a practical cooking technique but also a connection to my roots and a way to honor the past. I hope to continue making rice dumplings and maybe one day pass on this skill to younger members of my family.</p> <ol> <li>What can children learn from their parents?</li> <li>What knowledge can children learn from their grandparents?</li> <li>What kind of help do you think older people need?</li> <li>What skills can young people learn from older people?</li> <li>What new skills can old people learn?</li> <li>Do you think many old people in your country feel lonely?</li> </ol>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_speaking2.html#47","title":"\uff0847\uff09\u53bb\u8fc7\u7684\u4e61\u6751","text":"<p>Describe a countryside that you have been to</p> <p>You should say:</p> <p>Where it is</p> <p>When and why you went there</p> <p>Who you went there with</p> <p>And explain how you felt about it</p> <p>I'd like to talk about a trip I once took to the countryside outside of St. Petersburg, Russia. It was during the summer a few years ago when I had the opportunity to visit this serene and picturesque area. </p> <p>The place I visited was a small village called Pavlovsk. It's famous for its stunning imperial park and palace, which were once the summer residence of the Russian Tsars. The village itself had an old-world charm, with quaint\uff08\u53e4\u8272\u53e4\u4e61\u7684\uff09 wooden houses, gardens bursting with colorful flowers, and narrow, winding roads. It was such a refreshing change from the busy and bustling city life of St. Petersburg.</p> <p>What struck me most about the countryside there was how peaceful and quiet it was. As I walked along the park's shaded paths, I could hear nothing but the rustle of leaves and birds chirping. The air was incredibly fresh, and the scent of pine trees and wildflowers was everywhere. A lake in the park is surrounded by tall birch trees reflected in the calm, mirror-like water. It felt like I was stepping back in time to a simpler, more relaxed era.</p> <p>I also had the chance to interact with some of the locals, who were warm and welcoming. They even invited me to try some traditional Russian dishes, like blini and borscht, made from fresh ingredients grown in their gardens. This experience made the trip even more memorable because it gave me a glimpse into their way of life, which is so deeply connected to nature.</p> <p>Overall, visiting the countryside near St. Petersburg was a truly unforgettable experience. It gave me a much-needed break from the city's fast-paced environment and allowed me to immerse myself in the natural beauty and history of the area.

This invention revolutionized the way people live and work, and its impact is still felt today.</p> <p>The electric light bulb brought countless benefits to society. Before its invention, people relied on candles, oil lamps, or gas lights, which were not only dim but also hazardous and inconvenient. The light bulb provided a safer, brighter, and more reliable source of light, allowing people to extend their productive hours well into the night. This was particularly transformative for industries, as factories could operate around the clock, boosting productivity and economic growth.</p> <p>The influence of the light bulb spans across all age groups. For children, it means being able to study or read at night, which has greatly improved education and literacy rates. For working adults, it has enabled longer working hours and more efficient workspaces. Even for the elderly, it has improved safety and comfort at home, reducing the risks associated with older lighting methods like open flames.</p> <p>On a broader scale, the electric light bulb has fundamentally changed people\u2019s lives.

I found this short tutorial \uff08\u6559\u7a0b\uff09on TikTok, maybe around 10 minutes long, where the chef explained everything step by step\uff08\u4e00\u6b65\u6b65\uff09in such a clear and easy way. I watched it at home on my phone and decided to follow the steps.</p> <p>The video covered everything\uff08\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u4e8b\u60c5\uff09, from how to properly whisk the eggs\uff08\u6253\u9e21\u86cb\uff09 to how to fold in the flour without overmixing\uff08\u63ba\u6c34\u548c\u9762\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5931\u8861\uff09, which is super important for getting that light, fluffy texture\uff08\u8f7b\u76c8\u3001\u677e\u8f6f\u7684\u8d28\u5730\uff09. I also learned how to decorate the cake once it\u2019s done. I learned lot of things. Thank God it was easy to follow.</p> <p>I followed the recipe step by step religiously\uff08\u8654\u8bda\u5730\u4e00\u6b65\u6b65\u8ddf\u4e0b\u6765\uff09, and to my surprise\uff08\u8ba9\u6211\u60ca\u559c\u7684\u662f\uff09, the cake turned out great! It was light, soft, airy\uff08\u8f7b\u76c8\u3001\u7ef5\u8f6f\u3001\u900f\u6c14\u7684\uff09, and most importantly, delicious.

She\u2019s a few years older than me, and ever since we were kids, I\u2019ve always seen her with a book in hand. She\u2019s what people would call a real bookworm\uff08\u4e66\u866b\uff09. I mean, even when we  were all outside playing, she\u2019d be sitting in a corner with her nose buried in some novel\uff08\u9f3b\u5b50\u57cb\u5728\u67d0\u4e00\u90e8\u5c0f\u8bf4\u91cc\uff09. I first noticed this when I was around 10, and she was already reading these thick books from cover to cover\uff08\u4ece\u5934\u5230\u5c3e\uff09, like 300-400 pages long. That was quite impressive for me at that age. I was still reading comic books\uff08\u6f2b\u753b\u4e66\uff09 at that time, haha! And in terms of what she likes to read, well, over the years, I\u2019ve gotten to know her taste in books a bit better. She\u2019s really into a mix of things, from classic literature\uff08\u7ecf\u5178\u540d\u8457\uff09 to more modern stuff like sci-fi, fantasy and crime\uff08\u79d1\u5e7b\u3001\u9b54\u5e7b\u3001\u72af\u7f6a\uff09. But she\u2019s not picky\uff08\u6311\u5254\u7684\uff09. She\u2019ll read anything, as long as it\u2019s well-written and thoughprovoking\uff08\u5199\u5f97\u5f88\u597d\u4e14 \u60f9\u4eba\u6df1\u601d\uff09.  Finally, speaking of the reason she is so well-read\uff08\u9971\u8bfb\u8bd7\u4e66\uff09, I think she\u2019s just naturally curious and knowledge-driven\uff08\u5411\u5f80\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09. She\u2019s always looking to learn new things, and books are her way of exploring different ideas and worlds. Additionally, I guess it\u2019s her way of relaxing, you know? Some people watch TV or scroll through their phones; she just dives into a book and can spend hours in there. And more she reads, the easier it is for her to finish a book with full concentration. I guess it\u2019s like training. She\u2019s been training her \u201creading muscles\u201d her whole life, haha!</p> <ol> <li>Why are many people so keen on reading?</li> <li>Do you think parents should help their children develop the

Percentage of population in living cities</p> <p>This line graph illustrates the proportion of urban citizens in Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia between 1970 and 2020, with the expected population in 2030 and 2040.</p> <p>Overall, it can be easily seen from the graph that all four countries has a dramatic rise in population, starting at the lowest point in 1970 and being projected to reach the peak in 2040.</p> <p>Malaysia starts at 30%, about twice as much as Indonesia. After that, both showed an obvious increase, with the former rising to approximately 76% in 2020, and the latter rising to approximately 50%. Both sides are expected to continue rising thereafter, with Malaysia slowly rising to about 83%, while Indonesia is expected to see a 12% gain.</p> <p>The starting point of Philippines is about 31%, which is about 13% higher than Thailand. Over the next decade, the Philippines remained relatively stable. Between 1980 and 1990, the Philippines rose to about 48%, but fell to about 42% over the next 20 years. During this period, Thailand showed a gradual increase from 18% to approximately 30%. After 2010, both countries are expected to show an upward trend, rising to 55% and 49% respectively.</p> <p>2. changes in the size of the ozone hole</p> <p>The two line graphs illustrate changes in the size of the ozone hole over Antarctica and the production levels of three types of harmful gases (Freon, NO\u2082, and H\u2082O\u2082) from 1980 to 2000.</p> <p>Overall, the size of the Antarctic ozone hole expanded significantly over the 20-year period. The production of Freon initially rose before falling sharply, whereas NO\u2082 and H\u2082O\u2082 displayed steady increases towards the end of the period.</p> <p>In terms of the ozone hole size, it grew rapidly from approximately 50,000 square kilometers in 1980 to around 200,000 square kilometers by 1990. This increase was particularly steep between 1985 and 1990. Subsequently, the growth rate slowed, with the hole expanding more gradually to about 240,000 square kilometers by the year 2000.</p> <p>Regarding the production of damaging gases, Freon initially experienced an upward trend, peaking at 200,000 metric tons in 1985. However, its production then decreased dramatically, plummeting to around 20,000 metric tons by the end of the period. In contrast, the levels of NO\u2082 remained relatively stable at around 110,000 metric tons from 1980 to 1990, after which it saw a substantial rise, reaching 160,000 metric tons by 2000.</p> <p>Similarly, H\u2082O\u2082 production began at zero in 1980 but showed a gradual increase to approximately 18,000 metric tons by 1990. From this point onwards, it surged significantly, ending the period at 80,000 metric tons.</p> <p>3. numbers of participants for different activities</p> <p></p> <p>The line graph illustrates the number of participants involved in five activities\u2014film club, martial arts, amateur dramatics, table tennis, and musical performances\u2014at a social center in Melbourne, Australia, from 2000 to 2020.</p> <p>Overall, the film club consistently had the highest participation throughout the period, while amateur dramatics saw a steady decline. Musical performances, on the other hand, experienced a significant increase in participants, overtaking other activities except for the film club by 2020.</p> <p>The film club started at around 63 in 2000, and then fluctuated slightly before rising to nearly 65 by 2020. Martial arts had the second-largest participation initially, with about 35 attendees, and remained relatively stable over the period, with minor fluctuations.</p> <p>Amateur dramatics started with approximately 26 participants in 2000 but experienced a gradual decline, reaching less than 10 by 2020. In contrast, table tennis saw a remarkable growth over the years, surpassing amateur dramatics and martial arts in 2015 and climbing to over 50 participants by 2020.</p> <p>Musical performances showed a dramatic increase in popularity. Starting with no participants in 2000 and 2005, it rose rapidly, surpassing amateur dramatics around 2010. By 2020, it had reached nearly 20 participants.</p> <p>5. the percentage of the population living in cities</p> <p>The line graph illustrates the percentage of the population living in cities in four Asian countries\u2014Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia\u2014from 1970 to 2020, with projections for 2030 and 2040.</p> <p>It is clear that urbanization has increased in all four countries, with Malaysia having the highest proportion of urban residents, while Indonesia started with the lowest percentage.</p> <p>In 1970, both the Philippines and Malaysia had urban populations of around 30%. However, Malaysia's urbanization rate surged after 1990, reaching approximately 75% in 2020 and is projected to exceed 80% by 2040. In contrast, the Philippines experienced a slight decline between 1990 and 2010 before continuing its upward trend.</p> <p>Indonesia began with the lowest percentage (around 13%) but witnessed rapid urban growth, surpassing Thailand in 2000 and the Philippines in 2010. By 2040, it is expected to be the second most urbanized country among the four. Meanwhile, Thailand's urban population increased steadily from below 20% in 1970 to around 30% in 2020 and is predicted to reach approximately 45% by 2040.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_writing.html#pie-chart","title":"\u997c\u56fe pie chart","text":"<p>[!NOTE]</p> <p>compare countries and years together</p> <p>1.</p> <p>The three pie charts illustrate the proportion of four types of vehicles used in the UK in 1965, 1985, and 2005.</p> <p>Overall, there is a significant rise in the proportion of private cars over time, while the proportions of lorries and other commercial vehicles, as well as recreational vehicles, experience a gradual decrease.

The most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?</p> <p>The proposition that the most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives is a significant one, meriting thoughtful consideration. This essay will argue that, while the improvement of human lives is a crucial goal of science, it should not be viewed as its sole purpose. \u8981\u6539</p> <p>Firstly, the advancement of human welfare through scientific discovery has undeniably been monumental. Medical science, for instance, has dramatically enhanced the quality and longevity of life. The development of vaccines, antibiotics, and advanced surgical techniques has transformed healthcare, drastically reducing mortality rates and improving the management of chronic diseases. Moreover, technological innovations have reshaped daily life, offering unparalleled convenience and efficiency. The advent of the internet, smartphones, and smart home technology are prime examples of how science has made everyday tasks more accessible and interconnected.</p> <p>However, the pursuit of science for the sheer expansion of knowledge should also be recognized as an essential aim. Many scientific endeavors, such as space exploration or the study of fundamental physics, may not have immediate practical applications but are crucial for our understanding of the universe. The pursuit of such knowledge can lead to unforeseen benefits. For example, the exploration of space has led to the development of satellite communication, GPS technology, and numerous other applications that have had a considerable impact on daily life.</p> <p>Furthermore, it's important to consider the ethical and societal implications of focusing solely on science that improves human life. Such a focus might lead to the neglect of crucial environmental or ecological research, which may not have direct benefits for humans in the short term but are essential for the sustainability of life on Earth. Additionally, this approach might bias funding and attention towards projects with immediate commercial benefits, potentially at the expense of basic science research.</p> <p>In conclusion, while improving human lives is a vital goal of scientific endeavor, it should not be the only aim. The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and the exploration of questions beyond immediate human concerns are equally important. This broader perspective ensures a balanced approach to science, where the pursuit of understanding and the betterment of humanity go hand in hand.</p> <p>2. Space travel has been possible for some time and some people believe that space tourism could be developed in the future. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?</p> <p>Space travel, once a distant dream, has now become a reality. While some view space tourism as a promising industry, I firmly believe it is a negative development due to its exorbitant costs, severe environmental impact, and limited practical benefits.</p> <p>On the one hand, technological advancements have made space travel more feasible than ever before. Cutting-edge spacecraft and sophisticated engineering have enabled humanity to explore space and expand scientific knowledge. Furthermore, the commercialization of space technology has led to discussions about making space tourism available to civilians under expert supervision. Proponents argue that this could mark a new era of interplanetary travel and economic growth.</p> <p>However, despite these advancements, the drawbacks of space tourism far outweigh its potential benefits. Firstly, the cost of space travel remains prohibitively high, making it an exclusive privilege for the ultra-wealthy. This exacerbates social inequality, as vast financial resources are funneled into luxury space trips rather than addressing urgent global issues such as poverty, healthcare, and climate change. Secondly, the environmental consequences of space tourism are alarming. Rocket launches consume enormous amounts of fuel, releasing pollutants and greenhouse gases. Additionally, space travel generates substantial orbital debris, which poses long-term threats to both satellites and future missions.</p> <p>Moreover, space tourism offers little tangible benefit to society. Unlike scientific space exploration, which contributes to technological progress and planetary research, commercial space travel serves primarily as a form of entertainment for the elite. The destinations, such as the moon and Mars, offer no practical solutions to humanity\u2019s pressing challenges. Rather than investing in extravagant space tourism, resources should be directed toward sustainable space research and Earth-based advancements that benefit a larger population.</p> <p>In conclusion, while space tourism may capture public fascination, its negative implications\u2014including financial disparity, ecological damage, and minimal societal contribution\u2014render it an unsustainable and inequitable pursuit. Instead of prioritizing commercial space travel, efforts should be directed toward scientific exploration and the long-term survival of humanity, which remain the true objectives of space missions.</p> <p>3. In many countries nowadays, consumers can go to a supermarket and buy food produced all over the world. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?</p> <p>In the modern era, the ability to purchase food from all over the world in a local supermarket is undoubtedly a positive development. This trend not only reflects advancements in global logistics but also offers significant economic and cultural benefits.</p> <p>To begin with, the easy access to internationally produced food highlights the remarkable progress in global transportation and logistics. Modern technologies, such as international air freight and refrigerated shipping, allow perishable goods to be transported quickly and efficiently across vast distances. For instance, fresh seafood from Japan or tropical fruits from South America can now be delivered to consumers in Europe or North America within a matter of days, ensuring that the food remains fresh and of high quality. This convenience has revolutionized the way people shop for food, offering them a wider variety of choices than ever before.</p> <p>Moreover, the global trade of food products plays a crucial role in boosting national economies. By importing and exporting food, countries can diversify their markets and create new revenue streams. For consumers, the availability of foreign foods adds excitement to their diets, as they can explore cuisines from different cultures without leaving their hometowns. This increased demand for international products stimulates consumption and supports local businesses involved in the import and distribution of these goods. Additionally, governments benefit from the taxes and tariffs imposed on these goods, which can be reinvested into public services and infrastructure.</p> <p>However, some critics argue that the dominance of foreign food in local markets may threaten traditional agriculture and local food industries. While this concern is valid, it can be mitigated through policies that promote a balance between imported and domestic products. For example, governments can provide subsidies or incentives to local farmers to help them compete with international producers. Furthermore, consumers can be encouraged to support local food systems through awareness campaigns and labeling initiatives highlighting the benefits of buying locally produced goods.</p> <p>In conclusion, the globalization of food markets is a largely positive development that offers numerous benefits, including improved access to diverse foods, economic growth, and cultural exchange. While challenges such as the potential marginalization of local producers exist, these can be addressed through thoughtful policies and consumer education. Overall, this trend represents a win-win situation for both consumers and countries, fostering a more interconnected and prosperous global community.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_writing.html#discuss","title":"Discuss\u597d/\u574f","text":"<p>1. In many countries around the world, rural people are moving to cities, so the population in the countryside is decreasing. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?</p> <p>In numerous nations worldwide, the trend of rural populations migrating to urban areas is prominent, leading to a dwindling number of inhabitants in the countryside. This shift, in my opinion, embodies a double-edged sword, reflecting the complex dynamics of societal evolution.</p> <p>On the one hand, the allure of cities is undeniable. Urban centers, with their advanced infrastructure and abundant employment prospects, magnetize individuals seeking improved livelihoods. The superior quality of urban life, coupled with the automation of agricultural practices reducing rural labor demand, underscores the rationality behind this migration. Such developments signify progress, offering individuals the freedom to pursue a broader spectrum of opportunities.</p> <p>On the other hand, this influx into urban areas introduces several challenges. Skyrocketing housing prices, escalating traffic congestion, rising unemployment rates, and deteriorating living conditions due to pollution are immediate repercussions. Moreover, the urban expansion necessitates converting more land into cityscapes, potentially straining resources. The diminished rural workforce and reduced agricultural lands could hinder food production, highlighting a critical balance between consumption and production that must be maintained.</p> <p>Yet, the phenomenon of urbanization is not a one-way street. The concept of reverse urbanization\uff08\u9006\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\uff09, where individuals return to rural areas seeking respite from urban chaos, illustrates a natural recalibration process. This cycle suggests that concerns regarding urban overpopulation and rural depopulation may eventually equilibrate\uff08\u5e73\u8861\uff09.</p> <p>Hence, viewing rural-to-urban migration through a binary lens of positive or negative oversimplifies its implications. This movement is an intrinsic aspect of societal advancement, where the intertwined challenges and benefits will ultimately pave the way for a balanced development.</p> <p>2. In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Some people say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people. To what extent do the advantages of having an ageing population outweigh the disadvantages?</p> <p>While some people suggest the ageing population leads to problems for the government, others maintain it's beneficial to have more elderly people.</p> <p>On one hand, a vast number of elderly people create a significant financial burden for the government and the young. The government has to impose more taxes on young people mainly due to the social security for the elderly including pensions and healthcare fees to ensure their life quality. Meanwhile, the aging population may lead to a lack of labor because the base population doesn\u2018t change a lot but the proportion of the young is relatively low. Therefore, there are plenty of vacant positions in the workforce. This may contribute to the decline of the economy and the stagnancy of development, which the government has to introduce policies such as encouraging migrants to deter from getting worse.</p> <p>On the other hand, the increasing life span does imply that people have a better life in the modern world thanks to advanced medical technology and social welfare. The aging population may greatly promote the medical industry, as there's a large demand in inventing more efficient drugs and finding treatments of some rare diseases that haven't been cured. On top of that, the elderly may boost local tourism as some of them are reluctant to stay at home after retirement. They can pay a visit to a number of attractions they haven't gone in their young ages or have anticipated for a long time.</p> <p>In conclusion, the benefits of an increasingly older population are kinds of limited, only conducive to medical industry and tourism while the harmful effects potentially impacting the whole society can't be neglected, which is really a headache for the government.</p> <p>3. There are fewer and fewer differences between countries. People around the world may watch the same kinds of TV series, buy goods of the same brands, and follow the same trends. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon.</p>"},{"location":"abroad/IELTs_writing.html#report","title":"\u4e24\u95eeReport","text":"<p>1. Many countries believe that international tourism has harmful effects. Why do they think so? What can be done to change their views?</p> <p>In recent years, concerns have grown among some countries about the negative impacts of international tourism. From my perspective, overburdened infrastructure and harmful environmental practices are key reasons for these concerns, but targeted solutions can help change these views.</p> <p>Firstly, the increased accessibility of global travel has led to a surge in tourist numbers, often overwhelming local infrastructure. In popular destinations, public transportation, roads, and waste management systems can struggle to handle the influx. This overcrowding disrupts daily life for residents, reducing their quality of life. For example, cities like Venice frequently experience gridlock due to excessive tourist numbers, which creates tension between visitors and locals.</p> <p>Additionally, the behavior of some tourists can harm the environment and cultural sites. Littering, vandalism, and disrespect for historical landmarks are common issues. For instance, reports of tourists engraving names on ancient monuments not only damage these sites but also offend local communities. This type of conduct creates resentment and fuels negative perceptions of international tourism.</p> <p>To mitigate these negative effects of international tourism, several measures can be implemented. First, governments should invest in upgrading infrastructure to accommodate larger numbers of visitors without compromising the well-being of residents. This could include expanding public transport networks, improving waste management systems, and implementing sustainable tourism practices. Second, stricter regulations and penalties should be enforced to curb uncivilized behavior. Fines, community service, or even temporary bans from entering the country could serve as effective deterrents against tourists who break the rules. Moreover, fostering a culture of responsible tourism through educational campaigns can encourage visitors to respect local traditions and the environment. If visitors demonstrate respect and cultural sensitivity, locals are likely to feel more positively about their presence.</p> <p>In conclusion, while it is understandable that some countries are wary of international tourism, improving infrastructure, enforcing rules, and fostering responsible behavior can help mitigate its negative effects. This approach could allow countries to benefit economically from tourism while preserving their cultural and environmental integrity.</p> <p>2. An increasing number of people are choosing cosmetic surgeries. Why do people have operations to change the way they look ? Do you think this is a positive or negative development ?</p> <p>Nowadays, there is a prevalent trend of people opting for cosmetic surgeries to alter their appearance. From my perspective, this phenomenon is primarily driven by the influence of the internet and advancements in medical technology. Despite its growing popularity, I believe this trend has negative consequences.</p> <p>To begin with, the internet plays a pivotal role in shaping people's desire to pursue beauty. Social media platforms are flooded with images of flawless selfies, creating a culture of comparison and pressure among ordinary individuals. Many people feel insecure, envious, or even depressed when they compare their own appearance to these idealized images. As a result, they turn to cosmetic surgeries as a means of boosting their self-esteem and achieving a similar level of attractiveness to online celebrities. </p> <p>Moreover, advancements in medical technology have made cosmetic surgeries more accessible and safer than ever before. The development of sophisticated medical devices and techniques has enabled skilled surgeons to perform intricate procedures with minimal risk. Over the years, the cosmetic industry has evolved significantly, from simple skincare products to advanced surgical interventions, reflecting the rapid progress of technology in modern society. </p> <p>Despite these reasons, the increasing prevalence of cosmetic surgery is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it can have positive effects by boosting self-confidence and improving one\u2019s quality of life. Those who undergo successful procedures often report higher self-esteem and reduced anxiety related to their appearance. On the other hand, this trend may promote unrealistic beauty standards, leading to body dissatisfaction, particularly among young people. The normalization of cosmetic enhancements may pressure individuals to undergo unnecessary procedures, sometimes resulting in complications(\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7) or psychological distress. Moreover, prioritizing external appearance over inner qualities can foster a superficial society.</p> <p>In conclusion, although cosmetic surgery may offer short-term psychological relief for some, it perpetuates harmful beauty ideals and societal insecurities.

(250 words max)</li> </ol> <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have faced some challenges that, while initially daunting, have ultimately shaped my resilience and improved my ability. Mathematics was one of my early hurdles. During senior high school, I had no exposure to calculus like many peers, which left me feeling unprepared when I encountered it in college. </p> <p>I struggled to grasp the mathematical reasoning at first, reading textbooks again and again to acquire the knowledge and logic behind every question. Step by step, my effort finally paid off through my consistent practice though my mathematical abilities are still of average level.</p> <p>Similarly, computer programming was another pivotal challenge for a freshman like me with no prior experience. I found the transition into programming to be a significant shift in thinking. Adapting to this new field demanded both time and dedication as I navigated unfamiliar coding syntax and computational logic. Despite the steep learning curve, I embraced the opportunity to learn, eventually developing a passion for problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. Through much time and effort, I think I gradually mastered computer programming.</p> <p>These experiences have profoundly influenced my educational and professional development. They have taught me that challenges, despite the difficulty, are opportunities for growth and self-discovery. My journey from a novice programmer to someone doing cutting-edge research in deepfake detection exemplifies the rewards of hard work and adaptability. These lessons have not only prepared me for the rigors of graduate study but have also built my confidence to tackle complex problems and continuously strive for improvement.</p> <ol> <li>At Illinois, we value a student's ability to contribute to a community of inclusion, belonging, and respect where our graduate students can learn and collaborate productively and positively.

(250 words max)</li> </ol> <p>In my Fundamentals of Software Engineering course last semester, I was the leader of a group of 5 students. While we shared a common goal, my team members had distinct perspectives, personalities, and working habits. Thus, it was really a challenge for me as thoughtful coordination was required to ensure a productive and inclusive collaboration.</p> <p>In the group, I found some team members were always readily sharing their ideas, while others were a bit shy. To create an environment where everyone felt valued, I encouraged quieter members to share their thoughts, ensuring their voices were heard and integrated into our discussions. This approach not only enriched our project with diverse insights but also fostered a sense of belonging within the group.</p> <p>However, during the teamwork, one team member was initially disengaged, falling behind on his responsibilities. Regardless of the frustrating fact, I tried to iron out the issue with patience and understanding. Through open communication with my teammate, I sought to understand his perspectives, reset the goals to be more clear, and reschedule the deadlines to leave him enough time to finish his part. This proactive approach eventually worked a lot, making the whole project progress smoothly.</p> <p>This experience taught me the importance of empathy, adaptability, and effective communication in collaboration among individuals with different strengths and working styles. By creating a united and inclusive atmosphere and addressing problems constructively, I not only helped our team succeed but also mastered practical skills that I will bring to future academic and professional communities.</p>"},{"location":"other/Debug_issue.html","title":"Mkdocs\u7f51\u7ad9\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u95ee\u9898","text":"<p> \u7ea6 114 \u4e2a\u5b57
