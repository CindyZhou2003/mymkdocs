# Pattern Recognition

## Pattern Recognition

Pattern recoginition

-   input data: x
-   Label/output: y
-   x^(i)^ -> model/algorithm -> y^(i)^ ---inference/prediction
-   y=y^(k)^ where k= arg min || x(i)-x||^2=argmin d(x(i)-x)

`argmin` (argument of the minimum) finds the input value(s) that produce the minimum output of a function, rather than the minimum output itself

K Nearest Neighbor

## Linear Regression

线性回归

norm

transpose

Expectation: $E_{p(y)[f(y)]}=\sum_{y_i}p(y)f(y)$

arg min



Model: y=w_1\times x+w_2

Error: vertical lines

Set the derivative to zero



Regularization

$$\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{w} + C\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{X}\mathbf{Y} = 0$$

w ∗ = XX ⊤ + CI *−*1 XY

Higher Po



Maximize the likelihood of the given dataset $D = \{(x(i) , y(i) )\}$ assuming

samples to be drawn independently from an identical distribution

(i.i.d.).

IID? independent identical d

Joint distribution = product of individual distributions

-   not good for classification

Edge/Boundary detection



## Optimization

When can we find the optimum?

-   Least squares, linear, and convex programs can be solved

    efficiently and reliably



Convex set: A set is convex if for any two points w1, w2 in the set, the line segment $λw_1 + (1 − λ)w_2$ for λ ∈ [0, 1] also lies in the set.

Convex function
A function f is convex if its domain is a convex set, and for any points w1, w2 in the domain and any λ ∈ [0, 1]
f((1 − λ)w1 + λw2) ≤ (1 − λ)f(w1) + λf(w2)





Show that $log(1 + e^x)$ is convex for x ∈ R
