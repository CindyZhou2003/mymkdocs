### 【1 月新题】

#### （1）Colors（1.6）

1. What's your favorite color?

   > My favorite color is light green. I find it incredibly refreshing and calming at the same time. It gives me a sense of vitality, as it reminds me of nature, like fresh leaves in spring or a peaceful meadow. At the same time, it has a quiet and soothing quality that helps me feel relaxed, especially when I'm stressed. I think it's a perfect balance between energy and tranquility, which is why I'm drawn to it.

2. What's the color you dislike? Why?

   > I'm not really fond of brown. To me, it often looks a bit dirty and too dark, which makes it feel dull and unappealing. While I understand some people find it earthy and natural, it just doesn't resonate with me. I prefer colors that are more vibrant or calming, so brown isn't something I'd choose for my clothes or decor.

3. What colors do your friends like most?

   > Most of my friends don't have a strong preference for a particular color. They tend to choose colors based on the occasion or what suits them at the moment. For example, some might wear bright colors for a party but go for neutral tones like white or gray in their daily lives. I think they're quite flexible when it comes to colors.

4. What color makes you uncomfortable in your room?

   > I'd feel uncomfortable if my room were painted black. It's just too dark and gloomy for me, and it might even make the space feel smaller than it actually is. I associate black with depression or a lack of energy, so I'd much prefer lighter, more uplifting colors like light green or pastel tones to create a positive atmosphere.

5. Have you ever bought something because of its color?

   > Honestly, I've never bought anything solely because of its color. I'm more practical when it comes to shopping, so I prioritize functionality over appearance. For example, when I buy clothes or gadgets, I focus on whether they meet my needs rather than how they look. That said, if something has a nice color and is functional, it's definitely a bonus!

#### （2）Borrowing/ Lending（1.6）

1. Have you ever borrowed books from others?

   > Yes, I've borrowed books from others, especially when I was in school or university. It's a great way to access resources without having to buy them, and I've always made sure to return the books in good condition. Borrowing books also gives me a chance to explore new topics or authors that I might not have considered otherwise.

2. Have you ever borrowed money from others?

   > No, I've never borrowed money from others. I prefer to manage my finances carefully and avoid situations where I might need to rely on someone else for financial help. If I ever face a financial challenge, I'd try to find a solution on my own first, like cutting expenses or saving more.

3. Do you like to lend things to others?

   > Yes, I'm generally willing to lend things to others, especially if it's something they genuinely need. I believe in helping people out when I can, whether it's lending a book, a tool, or even offering advice. However, I do expect the person to return the item in good condition and within a reasonable time frame.

4. How do you feel when people don't return things they borrowed from you?

   > It depends on what they borrowed. If it's something small, like a pen or a notebook, I'd probably just let it go and not make a big deal. But if it's something more valuable or important, I'd be quite upset and might even go to their home to demand it back. In such cases, I'd also think twice before lending them anything again in the future.

#### （3）Hats/ Caps（1.9）

1. Is wearing hats popular in your country?

   > Yes, wearing hats is quite popular in my country. Many people wear different types of hats to match their outfits and enhance their overall style. For example, in the summer, you'll often see people wearing wide-brimmed 宽帽檐 hats or baseball caps to protect themselves from the sun while still looking fashionable. In winter, beanies and woolen hats are common because they're both practical and stylish. I think hats are a great way to add a touch of charm and personality to an outfit, so it's no surprise they're so popular.

2. Where do you like to buy hats?

   > online, convenient 

3. What kind of hats do you have?

   > Basically 2 kinds of hats. In the summer, I like to wear baseball caps because they're great for keeping the sun off my face and providing some shade. On the other hand, during the winter, I switch to knitted hats, as they help keep me warm and protect my ears from the cold. I find both styles not only practical but also easy to match with my outfits.

4. Do you like to wear hats?

   > not a big fan of hats, wear hats for its practical value

#### （4）Stories

1. What stories did you like when you were young?

   > When I was young, I was really into fantasy and fairy tales. I loved how these stories were full of imagination, magic, and often had themes of love and adventure. They transported me to different worlds where anything was possible, and I found that incredibly exciting. Stories like *Cinderella* or *Alice in Wonderland* were my favorites because they allowed me to dream big and escape reality for a while.

2. Do you prefer listening to stories or reading them?

   > I definitely prefer reading stories over listening to them. When I read, I can take my time to understand the plot and characters at my own pace, and I enjoy the tactile experience of holding a book or flipping through pages. It feels more personal and immersive. On the other hand, while listening to stories is easier and more convenient, especially when multitasking, I find it harder to fully engage with the story compared to reading.

#### （5）Gifts

1. Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?

   > Yes, I've sent handmade gifts to others, such as handmade cards. I think they're more personal and meaningful compared to store-bought items. Creating something by hand shows effort and thoughtfulness, which I believe makes the gift more special for the recipient.

2. Have you ever received a great gift?

   > Yes, I've received some great gifts in the past. One that stands out is a personalized photo album from a close friend. It was filled with memories from our time together, and I really appreciated the time and effort they put into creating it. It's something I still cherish today.

3. What do you consider when choosing a gift?

   > When choosing a gift, I consider the receiver's personality and hobbies. I try to pick something that reflects their interests or something they've mentioned wanting. For example, if they enjoy reading, I might choose a book by their favorite author. I believe a thoughtful gift shows that you truly understand and care about the person.

4. Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?

   > Yes, I think I'm good at choosing gifts. I pay attention to what people like and try to find something that suits their tastes or needs. I've received positive feedback from friends and family, which makes me feel confident in my ability to pick meaningful and appreciated gifts.

5. What gift have you received recently?

   > Recently, I received a down jacket as a gift. It was both practical and thoughtful, especially since winter was approaching. I really appreciated it because it showed that the person considered my needs and wanted to make sure I stayed warm during the cold season.

#### （6）Party

1. Do you like parties?

   > no

2. How often did you have a party when you were a kid?

   > never

3. Have you ever organized a party?

   > no

#### （7）Apps 

1. What apps have you recently used?

   > I've recently used Taobao and Red Note. Taobao is a popular Chinese e-commerce platform where I often buy daily necessities, clothes, and tech gadgets. Red Note, on the other hand, is a social app I use to  share my personal thoughts and browse notes posted by others. It helps me find many interesting things.

2. What kinds of apps are you usually interested in?

   > I'm generally interested in productivity and lifestyle apps. For instance, I enjoy using note-taking apps, task managers, and calendars to stay organized. I also like fitness tracking apps that help me monitor my exercise routines and sleep. I believe these types of apps help me be more efficient and maintain a balanced life.

3. How do you find out different apps?

   > I usually discover new apps through the app gallery on my phone or through recommendations from friends and social platforms. Sometimes, I'll read reviews on tech blogs or forums where people share their experiences with various apps. If an app is highly rated or frequently mentioned, I'm more likely to give it a try.

4. What kinds of apps would you like to use in the future?

   > In the future, I'd like to explore more apps related to personal finance management and mental well-being. I think apps that can help with budgeting or investment would be useful for better financial planning. Also, I'm interested in meditation or mindfulness apps that could assist me in reducing stress and improving my focus.

#### （8）Housework and cooking

1. Do you do some cooking/help your family cook at home now?

   > Actually, no, I don't know how to cook at the moment. I've never really had to, since my family usually takes care of meals. I'm not much of a cook, but I do enjoy eating well-prepared food, and I sometimes help with basic tasks like setting the table or cleaning up afterward.

2. Did you do some house cleaning when you were young?

   > Yes, when I was younger, I was responsible for some basic house cleaning tasks. I would help out with sweeping, dusting, and tidying up my room. It wasn't something I enjoyed particularly, but my parents made sure I contributed to keeping the house in order.

3. Do you have breakfast at home every day?

   > Not really. Since I live on campus now, I don't always have breakfast at home. Sometimes I have it at the school canteen, and other times I might skip it if I'm in a hurry or don't feel like eating early in the morning.

4. Do you want to learn how to cook well?

   > Yes, definitely. I think cooking is a really practical and useful skill to have. Not only is it cost-effective, but it also allows you to eat healthier and try different kinds of food. I would love to learn how to cook some basic meals at least.

5. Do you think your home is clean and tidy?

   > Well, it's probably not always as clean and tidy as I'd like it to be. I try to keep things organized, but with the busy schedule of studying, sometimes things pile up. It's more or less tidy, but definitely not spotless.

6. What housework do you like or dislike doing?

   > Frankly, I don't really enjoy housework at all. I find tasks like washing dishes or cleaning the floors a bit tedious. If I had to choose, I suppose I don't mind doing some light organizing or wiping down surfaces, but anything that requires too much effort isn't something I look forward to.

#### Quiet/Noisy Places

1. Do you like quiet or noisy places?

  > I prefer quiet places because they help me relax and focus. For example, I enjoy reading or studying in a quiet environment where I can concentrate without distractions. However, I don’t mind noisy places occasionally, especially if I’m with friends or at a social event.

2. Would you like to go to quiet or noisy places on weekends when you are free?

  > On weekends, I usually prefer quiet places, like a park or a café, where I can unwind and recharge after a busy week. However, if I’m in the mood for something lively, I might go to a noisy place, like a concert or a busy market, for a change of pace.

#### Young People

1. What activities do young people like to do in your country?

  > Young people in my country enjoy a variety of activities, such as playing video games, watching movies, and hanging out with friends. Many also like outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, or playing sports. Social media and online platforms are also popular for staying connected and sharing experiences.

2. Do you know what the fashion trend among young people is like in your country?

  > Yes, the current fashion trend among young people in my country leans towards casual and comfortable styles, like oversized clothing, sneakers, and streetwear. Many young people also follow global trends through social media, so you’ll see a mix of local and international influences.

#### Electronic Devices/Technology

1. Which technology do you use more often, computers or cellphones?

  > I use my cellphone more often because it’s portable and convenient for everyday tasks like messaging, browsing, and taking photos. However, I rely on my computer for more complex tasks, like studying or working on projects.

2. What electronic devices have you bought lately?

  > Recently, I bought a pair of wireless earbuds. They’re very convenient for listening to music or podcasts while on the go, and I appreciate how they eliminate the hassle of tangled wires.

3. Is there any new technology you want to buy?

  > Yes, I’d like to buy a smartwatch in the future. It seems like a useful device for tracking fitness, managing notifications, and staying organized, which would fit well with my lifestyle.

4. Is technology important in your life?

  > Yes, technology is very important in my life. It helps me stay connected, learn new things, and manage daily tasks efficiently. From studying to entertainment, technology plays a key role in almost every aspect of my routine.

5. Is there any technology you don't like?

  > I don’t particularly like overly complicated gadgets that are hard to use or require constant updates. For example, some smart home devices can be frustrating if they don’t work seamlessly or require too much setup.

6. How do you think technology trends today compare to when you were young?

  > Technology has advanced significantly since I was young. Back then, devices were simpler and less connected, like basic mobile phones and desktop computers. Now, everything is more integrated and portable, like smartphones and wearable tech, which makes life more convenient but also more fast-paced.

#### Public Gardens and Parks

1. Would you like to spend time in a public garden or park?

  > Yes, I enjoy spending time in public gardens or parks. They’re great for relaxing, taking a walk, or simply enjoying nature. It’s a nice escape from the busy city life and helps me clear my mind.

2. What do you like to do when visiting a park?

  > When visiting a park, I like to take a walk, sit on a bench and read, or have a picnic with friends. Sometimes, I also enjoy people-watching or taking photos of the scenery.

3. How are the parks today different from those you visited as a kid?

  > Parks today are more modern and well-maintained compared to when I was a kid. Many now have better facilities, like playgrounds, fitness equipment, and even Wi-Fi. However, I feel like they’re also more crowded now, which can take away from the peaceful atmosphere I remember from childhood.

4. Would you prefer to spend time in a private garden or a public garden?

  > I would prefer a private garden because it offers more privacy and tranquility. However, public gardens are also nice because they’re more spacious and often have a lively atmosphere, which can be enjoyable when I’m in the mood for socializing.

### 2024.10/11 月更新（24 道）

#### （1）Cars

1. Did you enjoy traveling by car when you were a kid?

   > Yes, I absolutely loved traveling by car when I was a kid. It was always exciting because it usually meant we were going somewhere fun, like an amusement park or a scenic spot. I remember feeling a sense of adventure and anticipation during those trips, and I'd often look out the window, enjoying the view and imagining what the destination would be like.

2. What types of cars do you like?

   > I'm particularly fond of big SUV cars, like Jeeps. They're not only comfortable but also very spacious, which makes long journeys much more enjoyable. I also like how they're designed for both city driving and off-road adventures, giving a sense of versatility and freedom. Plus, they feel safer and more robust compared to smaller cars.

3. Do you prefer to be a driver or a passenger?

   > I prefer being a passenger rather than a driver. Driving can be quite tiring, especially on long trips, and it requires a lot of focus. As a passenger, I can relax, enjoy the scenery, and even take a nap if I want to. It's a much more stress-free experience, and I can fully appreciate the journey without worrying about the road.

4. What do you usually do when there is a traffic jam?

   > When there's a traffic jam, I usually try to make the most of the time by taking a nap or watching TV dramas on my phone. It's a good way to kill time and stay entertained, especially if the jam lasts for a while. Sometimes, I also listen to music or podcasts to keep myself relaxed and distracted from the frustration of being stuck in traffic.

5. Do you think car colors are important?

   > Yes, I think car colors are quite important. For certain vehicles, like police cars or ambulances, the color combination serves a functional purpose, making them easily recognizable in emergencies. For private cars, the color often reflects the owner's personality or style. For example, someone who chooses a bright red car might be seen as bold and energetic, while a black or white car might suggest a more classic or sophisticated taste.

#### （2）Mirrors

1. Do you like looking at yourself in the mirror? How often?

   > Yes, I do like looking at myself in the mirror, and I do it several times a day. Mostly, it's to check my attire and make sure I look presentable before leaving the house or attending an event. It's become a habit for me to quickly glance in the mirror to ensure everything is in place, like my hair or outfit.

2. Have you ever bought mirrors?

   > Yes, I've bought a small mirror before. I have one in my dormitory that I use for daily grooming, like styling my hair or applying skincare products. It's compact and convenient, so it doesn't take up much space, which is perfect for a small living area like a dorm room.

3. Do you usually take a mirror with you?

   > No, not really. I don't feel the need to carry a mirror with me all the time. I think it's unnecessary because I don't have to check my appearance constantly. If I really need to, I can use my phone's camera or find a mirror in public places like restrooms.

4. Would you use mirrors to decorate your room?

   > No, I wouldn't use mirrors to decorate my room, especially not in front of the bed. In Chinese culture, it's considered unlucky to place a mirror directly opposite the bed, as it's believed to bring negative energy or disturb sleep. So, I'd avoid using mirrors for decorative purposes in my room, even though they can make spaces look bigger and brighter.

#### （3）Emails

1. Do you often send emails?

   > No, I don't send emails very often. I only use email when it's the only way to contact someone, like for formal communication with institutions, companies, or for official purposes. In my daily life, I prefer using WeChat to stay in touch with friends, family, or teachers because it's more convenient and instant. Emails feel a bit more formal and time-consuming, so I only resort to them when necessary.

2. When would you send emails to others?

3. ls sending emails popular in china?

   > No. Many social media platforms

4. Do you think sending emails will be more or less popular in the future?

   > I'm not sure. Maybe remain the same

#### （4）Advertisement

1. Is there an advertisement that made an impression on you when you were a child?

   > Yes, there's one advertisement that left a lasting impression on me when I was a child. It was for a brand of mineral water, and what made it memorable was its unique storytelling approach. The ad featured a man and a woman trapped in a rock cave, and while the story was dramatic and engaging, it didn't seem to have much to do with the water itself. I remember being fascinated by the creativity, even though I didn't fully understand the connection at the time.

2. Do you see a lot of advertising on trains or other transport?

   > Yes, I see a lot of advertising on public transport, especially on subways. There are posters and digital screens everywhere. It's hard to miss them because they're strategically placed in high-traffic areas, like inside the train cars or on the platform walls. While some ads are creative, others can feel a bit overwhelming due to their sheer volume.

3. Do you like advertisements?

   > No, not really. I find that advertisements often consume a lot of my time without adding much value to my life. For example, when I'm watching a video or browsing online, ads can interrupt the experience, and most of them don't seem relevant to me. While I understand their purpose, I generally find them more annoying than helpful.

4. What kind of advertising do you like?

   > I prefer storytelling ads that don't directly promote a specific product. These ads often use creative narratives or emotional themes to engage the audience, making them more memorable and enjoyable to watch. For example, I've seen ads that tell a heartwarming story or showcase a unique concept, and only at the end do they subtly introduce the product. I find this approach much more appealing than traditional ads that simply push a product in your face.

#### （5）Computers

1. In what conditions would you use a computer?

   > I use a computer mainly for studying and programming since I'm majoring in software engineering. It's an essential tool for completing assignments and writing code. I also use it for research, online classes, and sometimes for entertainment, like watching videos or playing games. Without a computer, it would be almost impossible to keep up with my coursework.

2. When was the first time you used a computer?

   > The first time I used a computer was in grade 3, during an IT class at school. I remember being fascinated by how it worked and feeling excited to learn something so modern and advanced at the time. That class introduced me to basic functions like typing and using simple software, which sparked my interest in technology.

3. What would your life be like without computers?

   > I honestly can't imagine my life without computers. They've become such an integral part of daily life, not just for me but for everyone. For example, I rely on them for studying, communication, and even entertainment. Without computers, tasks would take much longer, and many modern conveniences we take for granted would simply disappear. It would feel like going back in time.

4. In what conditions would it be difficult for you to use a computer?

   > It would be difficult to use a computer while traveling, especially if there's no proper desk or stable surface to place it on. For instance, on a crowded train or bus, it's hard to balance a laptop and focus on the screen. Additionally, if there's no reliable internet connection or power source, using a computer becomes inconvenient or even impossible.

#### （6）Old buildings

1. Have you ever seen old buildings in the city?

   > Yes, I've seen quite a few old buildings in the city center. In my city, there are still some traditional residential areas called *Nongtang* in Chinese. These buildings have a unique architectural style and reflect the city's history and culture. Walking through these areas feels like stepping back in time, and it's fascinating to see how people lived in the past.

2. Do you think we should preserve old buildings in cities?

   > Yes, I strongly believe we should preserve some old buildings because of their historical and cultural value. They serve as a reminder of the city's heritage and help us understand how life used to be. Additionally, they often attract tourists, which can benefit the local economy. However, it's also important to balance preservation with modern development to meet the needs of a growing population.

3. Do you prefer living in an old building or a modern house?

   > I definitely prefer living in a modern house. Modern buildings are designed with convenience and comfort in mind, featuring amenities like elevators, better insulation, and advanced facilities. Old buildings, while charming, often lack these modern comforts and can be less practical for daily living. For me, functionality and comfort are more important than historical appeal when it comes to choosing a place to live.

4. Are there any old buildings you want to see in the future? why?

#### （7）Feeling bored

1. Do you often feel bored?

   > No, I don't often feel bored because I always keep myself busy and try to find something new to do. Whether it's studying, working on a project, or exploring a new hobby, I make sure my time is filled with meaningful activities. I think staying productive and curious helps me avoid boredom.

2. When would you feel bored?

   > I usually feel bored when I don't have a clear plan or goal and don't know what to pursue. For example, if I have a free day with no schedule or tasks, I might feel a bit lost and end up doing nothing productive. In those moments, boredom creeps in because I lack direction or motivation.

3. What do you do when you feel bored?

   > When I feel bored, I usually browse social media platforms like Red Note or Weibo to pass the time. Sometimes, I also try to pick up a new hobby, like cooking or painting, to keep myself engaged. These activities help me break the monotony and add a bit of excitement to my day.

4. Do you think childhood is boring or adulthood is boring?

   > I think adulthood is more boring compared to childhood. As a child, life was carefree and full of curiosity, with no major responsibilities. However, adulthood is often dominated by work, family obligations, and routine, which can feel monotonous over time. While adulthood has its rewards, it lacks the spontaneity and freedom that made childhood so exciting.

#### （8）Lost and found

1. What will you do if you find something lost by others?

   > If I find something lost by others, I would take it to the lost and found office. I think it's the most practical and responsible way to handle the situation, as it increases the chances of the item being returned to its owner. If there's no lost and found office nearby, I might **hand it over** to the manager or staff of the place where I found it.

2. Do you report to the police when finding something lost by others? Why?

   > I usually don't report to the police immediately when I find something lost. Instead, I'd first take it to the lost and found office or inform the manager of the place where I found it. Reporting to the police would be **my last resort**, especially if the lost item is very expensive or valuable, like a wallet or a phone. I think this approach is more efficient and avoids unnecessary complications.

3. Have you ever lost things?

   > Yes, I've lost things quite a few times. When I was in primary school, I often lost small items like erasers or rulers because I wasn't very organized back then. In college, I once lost my keys, which was quite stressful because I needed them to access my dorm room. Luckily, I found them after retracing my steps, but it taught me to be more careful with my belongings.

4. Will you post on social media if you lose your item?

   > Yes, I would post about it on social media, especially on platforms like my school forum or community groups. I think it's a quick and effective way to reach a large number of people who might have seen or found the lost item. It's also a way to appeal to the kindness of others, as someone might come across the post and help me recover what I've lost.

#### （9）Talents

1. Do you have a talent or something you are good at?

   > Yes, I'm good at making things and DIY projects. I enjoy creating or repairing things with my hands, whether it's assembling puzzles, crafting decorations, or even fixing small household items. It's a skill that I find both practical and satisfying.

2. Was it mastered recently or when you were young?

   > I think I developed this talent when I was young. I've always been curious about how things work and loved tinkering with tools or materials. Over time, I've improved my skills through practice and experience, but the foundation was definitely laid during my childhood.

3. Do you think your talent can be useful for your future work? Why?

   > Yes, I believe my creativity and DIY skills can be useful for my future work. In many fields, especially those related to design, engineering, or even problem-solving, creativity is highly valued. Being able to **think outside the box** and create practical solutions could **give me an edge** in my career.

4. Do you think anyone in your family has the same talent?

   > Yes, my mother also has a similar talent. She's very ingenious and often comes up with creative solutions for everyday problems. Whether it's repurposing old items or finding clever ways to organize our home, her creativity has definitely inspired me and influenced my own skills.

#### （10）Evening time

1. Do you like the morning or evening?

   > I prefer the morning because it's filled with sunshine and a sense of freshness. I feel more energetic and productive during this time, and it's a great way to start the day. The quiet and calm atmosphere in the morning also helps me focus better.

2. What do you usually do in the evening?

   > In the evening, I usually do my homework or review my classes. It's a time when I can reflect on what I've learned during the day and make sure I'm prepared for the next. Sometimes, I also relax by watching a show or reading a book to unwind after a busy day.

3. What did you do in the evening when you were little? Why?

   > When I was little, I used to cycle around the neighborhood or watch TV at home in the evening. **Back then** 那时, I didn't have much homework, and classes ended early, around 3 pm, so I had plenty of free time to relax and enjoy myself. It was a carefree and fun part of my childhood.

4. Are there any differences between what you do in the evening now and what you did in the past?

   > Yes, there's a big difference. When I was younger, evenings were all about playing and relaxing, like cycling or watching TV. Now, evenings are more about being productive—completing homework, reviewing lessons, or preparing for the next day. I have less free time, but I still try to balance work with some relaxation.

#### （11）Dreams

1. Do you often remember your dreams?

   > No, I don't often remember my dreams. Most of the time, I wake up with only a vague impression of what I dreamed about, if anything at all. Occasionally, I'll remember a particularly vivid or strange dream, but those instances are rare.

2. Do you share your dreams with others? (or Are you interested in others'dreams? )

   > Sometimes, I share my dreams with others, especially if someone I know was in the dream. It can be amusing or interesting to talk about. However, I'm not particularly interested in hearing about other people's dreams unless they're really unique or funny.

3. Do you think dreams have special meanings?

   > No, I don't believe dreams have special meanings. I'm more of a materialist, so I see dreams as random brain activity during sleep rather than something symbolic or prophetic 预言性的. While they can be entertaining or thought-provoking, I don't take them seriously.

4. Do you want to make your dreams come true?

   > No, I don't want to make my dreams come true because most of them are ridiculous or unrealistic. For example, I've had dreams where I'm flying or doing something completely illogical. While they're fun to think about, they're not something I'd want to pursue in real life.

#### （12）Street Market

1. What do people usually buy on the street market?

   > People usually buy small gadgets and street food at street markets. These markets are known for their affordable and unique items, like accessories, household tools, or handmade crafts. Street food is also a big attraction, offering a variety of local snacks and dishes that you can't always find in regular stores.

2. Do you prefer to go shopping in the shopping mall or on the street market?

   > I prefer shopping in a shopping mall because it's more organized and comfortable. Malls have a wide range of products, from clothing to electronics, all under one roof, and they often provide amenities like air conditioning and clean restrooms. Street markets, while lively and colorful, can be crowded and chaotic, which I find less enjoyable.

3. When was the last time you went to a street market?

   > I don't remember the last time I went to a street market because I rarely visit them. I tend to avoid them unless there's something specific I'm looking for, like a unique item or a particular type of street food. Most of my shopping is done in malls or online.

4. Are there many street markets in China?

   > Yes, there are many street markets in China, especially in larger cities and towns. They are an important part of the local culture and economy, offering everything from fresh produce to handmade goods. While they might not be as popular as they once were due to the rise of shopping malls and online shopping, they still thrive in many areas.

4. What are the differences between swimming in the pool and swimming in the sea?

   > There are several differences between swimming in a pool and swimming in the sea. In a pool, the water is clean, controlled, and usually calm, making it safer and more predictable. However, the sea offers a more dynamic experience with waves, currents, and natural surroundings, which can be both exciting and challenging.

3. Where do you often meet each other?

3. Have you ever read a novel that has been adapted into a film?

   > Yes, I've read *The Wandering Earth*, which was adapted into a film. Interestingly, I watched the movie first and then read the book. While the movie was visually stunning, the book provided more depth and detail, which made the story even more engaging.

4. Which do you prefer, reading books or watching movies?

   > I prefer reading books because they allow me to use my imagination and engage more deeply with the story. Books often provide more details and insights into the characters and plot, which I find more satisfying than the condensed version typically presented in movies.

5. Do you read more or less now than when you were younger?

   > I think I read less now than when I was younger. Back then, I had more free time and fewer responsibilities, so I could spend hours reading. Now, with schoolwork and other daily commitments, it's harder to find time to read as much as I'd like. However, I still try to make reading a regular part of my routine.

#### （18）Sitting down

1. Where is your favorite place to sit?

2. Do you always sit down for a long time?

   > No, I try not to sit for long periods because I know it's unhealthy. Prolonged sitting can lead to back pain and other health issues, so I make an effort to stand up, stretch, or take short walks throughout the day. It's important to stay active, even if I'm working or studying.

3. Do you feel sleepy when you are sitting down?

   > Sometimes, I do feel sleepy when sitting down, especially if I haven't had enough sleep the night before. The comfort of the sofa or a cozy chair can make it tempting to doze off, but I try to stay awake and focused if I have tasks to complete.

5. Do you find it easy to fall asleep when sitting on a sofa?

   > I rarely sleep on the sofa because I prefer sleeping in bed. While the sofa is comfortable, it's not ideal for a proper nap or a good night's sleep. If I'm really tired, I might doze off on the sofa for a short while, but I always try to move to my bed for a more restful sleep.

2. Do you often use your mobile phone for texting or calls?

3. When do you find it hard to allocate time?

#### （23）Taking photos

1. Do you like taking photos?

   > Not really. I prefer appreciating the views or shows directly with my eyes rather than through a camera. I feel that sometimes focusing on taking photos can distract me from fully experiencing the moment.

That said, I do take photos occasionally, especially when I want to share something special with friends or family.

2. Do you like taking selfies?

   > I sometimes take selfies, especially when I'm out with friends. It's a fun way to capture memories and document our time together. However, I don't take selfies too often because I prefer candid or natural shots rather than posed ones. It's more about the moment than the photo itself for me.

**1. What kinds of jobs need a lot of physical work?**
Jobs that require a lot of physical work typically include construction work, farming, manufacturing, and roles in the service industry like cleaning or delivery services. These jobs often involve heavy lifting, long hours of standing, or repetitive tasks that demand physical strength and endurance. For example, construction workers need to carry heavy materials and operate machinery, while farmers spend hours in the fields under challenging weather conditions. These roles are essential for society but can be quite demanding on the body.

**2. What's the difference between the payment for physical work and that for mental work?**
Generally, jobs that require mental work, such as those in technology, finance, or management, tend to offer higher salaries compared to physical labor jobs. This is because mental work often involves specialized skills, education, and decision-making responsibilities, which are highly valued in the job market. On the other hand, physical work, while equally important, is sometimes seen as less specialized and more replaceable, which can lead to lower wages. However, there are exceptions, such as skilled tradespeople or athletes, who can earn significant incomes due to their expertise or physical abilities.

**3. Can physical workers receive higher salaries in the future?**
It's possible, but it depends on several factors. For instance, if there's a shortage of physical workers in certain industries, their salaries might increase due to higher demand. Additionally, as automation becomes more common, skilled physical workers who can operate or maintain advanced machinery might see their wages rise. However, in many cases, physical work may still be undervalued compared to mental work unless there's a significant shift in how society perceives and rewards these roles.

**4. Do you think machines could replace human workers in the future?**
Yes, to some extent, machines are already replacing human workers, especially in repetitive or dangerous tasks. For example, in manufacturing, robots are now commonly used for assembly lines, and in agriculture, machines can harvest crops more efficiently. However, I don't think machines will completely replace humans because many jobs require creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex decision-making, which machines cannot replicate. Instead, I believe the future will involve humans working alongside machines to improve productivity and safety.

**5. Do you think you are an energetic person?**
Yes, I consider myself an energetic person. I'm always eager to ==take on new challenges== and stay active, whether it's at work, during exercise, or in my personal life. I find that being energetic helps me stay motivated and productive, and I enjoy pushing myself to achieve my goals. However, I also make sure to balance my energy with proper rest and relaxation to avoid burnout.

**6. Do you think there was more physical labor in the past than there is now?**
Absolutely. In the past, physical labor was much more common because many tasks had to be done manually due to the lack of technology. For example, farming, construction, and manufacturing relied heavily on human effort. However, with the advancement of technology and automation, many of these tasks are now performed by machines, reducing the need for physical labor. While physical work still exists, it's less prevalent than it used to be, and more people are now engaged in mental or service-oriented jobs.

#### （2）近期日常改变

Describe a positive change that you have made recently in your daily routine

You should say:

What the change is

How you have changed the routine

Why you think it is a positive change

And explain how you feel about the change

>  A positive change I recently made to my daily routine is ==adjusting my sleep schedule==. I used to stay up late almost every night, spending hours browsing apps like Red Book to entertain myself. While it was fun at the time, I realized it ==left me feeling tired and unproductive== the next day.
>
>  Now, I've set my mind to getting up early and sleeping early. At first, it was challenging to break the habit, but I started by setting a strict bedtime and avoiding using my phone before bed. Instead, I read a book or listen to relaxing music to ==wind down==.
>
>  This change has made a big difference in my life. Waking up early gives me extra time in the morning to prepare for the day, whether it's exercising, eating a proper breakfast, or planning my tasks. I also feel more energized and focused throughout the day, which has ==improved my productivity and overall mood==.
>
>  Looking back, I'm glad I made this change. It's a small adjustment, but it has had a positive impact on both my physical and mental health. I now feel more in control of my time and enjoy my days much more.
>

 **1. What do people normally plan in their daily lives?**
People usually plan a variety of activities in their daily lives, such as work or study schedules, household chores, exercise routines, and social engagements. For example, many people plan their work tasks to meet deadlines, schedule time for grocery shopping or cooking, and allocate time for hobbies or relaxation. Additionally, some people plan their commutes or childcare arrangements to ensure everything runs smoothly. Planning helps individuals stay organized and manage their time effectively, especially when balancing multiple responsibilities.

**2. Is time management very important in our daily lives?**
Yes, time management is crucial in our daily lives because it helps us prioritize tasks, avoid procrastination, and achieve our goals efficiently. Without proper time management, people might feel overwhelmed, miss deadlines, or struggle to balance work and personal life. For instance, students need to manage their time to complete assignments and prepare for exams, while working professionals must juggle meetings, projects, and personal commitments. Good time management can reduce stress and improve productivity, making it an essential skill for everyone.

**3. What changes would people often make?**
People often make changes to their routines, habits, or lifestyles to improve their well-being or achieve specific goals. For example, someone might change their diet to eat healthier, adjust their sleep schedule to get more rest, or start exercising regularly to stay fit. Others might change their work habits, such as organizing their tasks better or setting clearer priorities. Additionally, people might make changes to their social lives, like spending more time with family or pursuing new hobbies. These changes are usually aimed at enhancing quality of life or addressing challenges.

**4. Do you think it is good to change jobs frequently?**
No, I don't think it's good to change jobs frequently because it takes a lot of time and effort to adapt to a new workplace, learn new skills, and build relationships with colleagues. Frequent job changes can also make it difficult to establish a stable career path or gain deep expertise in a particular field. Employers might also view this as a lack of commitment. However, there are exceptions—if someone is unhappy in their current role or finds a better opportunity, changing jobs can be beneficial. But overall, stability is usually more advantageous in the long term.

**5. Who do you think would make changes more often, young people or old people?**
I think young people are more likely to make changes frequently because they are still exploring their options and figuring out what they want in life. For example, young people might change jobs, move to new cities, or try different hobbies as they seek new experiences and opportunities. On the other hand, older people tend to be more settled in their routines and preferences, so they might make fewer changes unless necessary. However, this isn't always the case, as some older individuals might also embrace change to adapt to new circumstances or pursue personal growth.

**6. Who should get more promotion opportunities in the workplace, young people or older people?**
I believe both young and older people should have equal opportunities for promotion, as it should depend on their skills, performance, and contributions rather than their age. Younger employees might bring fresh ideas, energy, and technological expertise, while older employees often have valuable experience, wisdom, and leadership qualities. A fair workplace should recognize and reward talent and hard work regardless of age. This approach not only fosters a positive work environment but also ensures that the organization benefits from the strengths of all its employees.

>
>  We had been together for about three years, and during that period of time, I was in two minds（犹豫，纠结） all the time. *On one hand*, he was funny and charming. He could really make me laugh. I loved his sense of humor （我喜欢他的幽默感） and his charisma. *On the other hand*, he was a control freak. He always wanted me to listen to him, and say yes to him. He really put a lot of pressure on me. I mean, I'm an independent person with an independent mind, so I couldn't just blindly follow his commands（跟随他的指令）. He was very bossy（霸道的） and macho（大男子主义的）.
>
>  I **was torn between**（很纠结） leaving and staying. I didn't want to rush into the decision（匆忙做决定）, so I waited long enough because I wanted to give it a chance. After being together for three years, I was very unhappy, so I finally made up my mind（彻底下决定） to leave him. I told him about my decision. It wasn't easy for me. I was crying and having a meltdown when I saw him for the last time. And he refused to take it. We were not **on the same page** at all（意见不一致，他不想分手）.
>
>  After the breakup, in the beginning, he was still trying to influence my decision by constantly calling me and trying to see me. It was extremely difficult for me to not pick up the phone. But I pulled myself together（振作起来）. I didn't give him any chances to talk to me. And eventually, after 6 months, he gave up.
>  I'm now feeling so much better without him. ==Everything is water under the bridge==（事情都过去了）. Even though I still miss him sometimes, I know it will all be over one day. Time will heal everything（时间会治愈一切）. It was a tough decision to make, but it was the right thing to do.

**1. Do you think children sometimes have to make important decisions?**
Yes, I believe children sometimes have to make important decisions, although these decisions might not seem as significant from an adult's perspective. For example, children might need to decide which extracurricular activities to join, how to manage their time between schoolwork and hobbies, or how to handle conflicts with friends.

In places like parks or museums, people are expected to stay on marked paths, avoid damaging property, and follow instructions from staff. Additionally, social etiquette, such as being polite and considerate of others, is important in maintaining a harmonious environment. These rules ensure that public spaces remain enjoyable and accessible for everyone.

**5. What are the reasons that cause people to break rules?**
People might break rules for various reasons, such as lack of awareness, convenience, or rebellion. For instance, someone might not know about a specific rule or misunderstand its importance. Others might break rules to save time or effort, like jaywalking (乱穿马路) to avoid a long detour. In some cases, people might intentionally break rules as a form of protest or to challenge authority. Stress or emotional distress can also lead to rule-breaking, as individuals might act impulsively without considering the consequences. Understanding these reasons can help address the root causes of rule violations.

**6. When people break rules, how would they be punished in your country?**
In my country, the punishment for breaking rules depends on the severity of the violation. For minor offenses, such as littering or noise complaints, people might receive a warning or a fine. More serious violations, like breaking traffic laws or damaging public property, can result in heavier fines, community service, or even legal action. In schools or workplaces, rule-breakers might face disciplinary measures like suspension or loss of privileges. The goal of these punishments is to discourage rule-breaking and encourage individuals to act responsibly.

Describe your grandparents'job

You should say:

what it was

how long he or she had this job

how he or she got the job

what skills this job needs

and whether you would like to have this job in the future

>  I'd like to talk about my grandmother, who was a farmer for most of her life. She worked in agriculture, growing crops like rice, wheat, and vegetables on a small family farm in the countryside. She had this job for over 40 years, starting when she was very young and continuing until she retired in her late 60s.
>
> My grandmother got into farming because it was a family tradition. Her parents were also farmers, so she learned the skills and knowledge from them from a very early age. She didn't ==have a formal education in agriculture==, but she had a lot of ==practical experience and understood the land==, the seasons, and how to grow different crops.
>
> Being a farmer requires a wide range of skills. For example, you need to be physically strong because farming involves a lot of manual labor, like planting, harvesting, and ==carrying heavy loads==. You also need to be patient and resilient because farming depends heavily on the weather, and sometimes crops can fail due to droughts or floods. Additionally, my grandmother had to be very ==resourceful and creative in solving problems==, like finding ways to protect crops from pests or managing limited resources.
>
> As for whether I'd like to have this job in the future, I don't think so. While I deeply respect my grandmother's hard work and dedication, farming is a very ==demanding== job, both physically and mentally. I also think it's quite unpredictable because of factors like climate change, which makes it even more challenging. However, I do admire the connection to nature and the sense of independence that comes with farming. ==It's just not the right career path for me personally.==

And explain why you made it

>  I'd like to talk about a promise I made to my cousin a few years ago. At the time, she was preparing for her final high school exams, and she was feeling extremely ==stressed and overwhelmed==. She had always struggled with math, and she was worried that she wouldn't be able to pass the exam. One evening, she came to me, almost in tears, and asked for my help. I promised her that I would tutor her every day until her exams and help her improve her math skills.
>
> After I made the promise, I felt ==a strong sense of responsibility== to keep it. At first, I thought it would be easy because I was confident in my own math abilities, but it turned out to be more challenging than I expected. I had to sacrifice a lot of my free time to sit with her, explain concepts, and practice problems. There were moments when I felt frustrated because she didn't grasp things as quickly as I hoped, but I reminded myself of the promise I had made and pushed through.
>
> The reason I made this promise was because ==I could see how much it meant to her==. She trusted me to help her, and I didn't want to let her down. I also knew how important these exams were for her future, and I wanted to do everything I could to support her. In the end, she managed to pass her math exam with a decent grade, and she was incredibly grateful for my help. Seeing her relief and happiness made all the effort worthwhile.
>
> This experience taught me the importance of keeping promises, especially when they involve someone who depends on you. It also ==strengthened my relationship== with my cousin, as she knew she could count on me when she needed help the most.

**1. Why do some people fail to keep their promises?**
There are several reasons why people might fail to keep their promises. Sometimes, it's due to unforeseen circumstances, such as sudden illness or emergencies, which make it impossible to follow through. Other times, people might overcommit themselves and realize they don't have the time or resources to fulfill their promises. In some cases, a lack of sincerity or responsibility can also lead to broken promises, as individuals might make commitments without intending to keep them. Additionally, poor communication or misunderstandings can result in promises being unintentionally broken.

**2. Do children keep their promises?**
Children often try to keep their promises, but their ability to do so depends on their age, maturity, and understanding of the commitment. Younger children might struggle to keep promises because they are still learning about responsibility and the importance of follow-through. For example, a child might promise to clean their room but get distracted by playing. However, as children grow older and develop a stronger sense of accountability, they are more likely to keep their promises, especially if they understand the consequences of breaking them.

**3. Do parents in China make promises to their children?**
Yes, parents in China, like parents everywhere, often make promises to their children. These promises can range from small, everyday commitments, like buying a toy or taking them to the park, to more significant ones, such as rewarding good grades or planning a family vacation. Promises are often used as a way to motivate children or encourage positive behavior. However, Chinese parents generally emphasize the importance of keeping promises to teach their children about trust and responsibility, as these values are deeply rooted in Chinese culture.

**4. What kinds of promises do people often make?**
People make a wide variety of promises depending on the context. In personal relationships, promises often revolve around emotional commitments, such as being supportive or staying loyal. In professional settings, promises might include meeting deadlines, delivering quality work, or fulfilling contractual obligations. On a daily basis, people might make smaller promises, like showing up on time or helping a friend with a task. Additionally, people often make promises to themselves, such as committing to a healthier lifestyle or learning a new skill. These promises reflect the values and priorities of individuals in different aspects of life.

Describe a line (or a few words) that you remember from a poem or song

You should say

What it is

Which song or poem it is from

How you knew it

And explain how you feel about it

> One line that has always stayed with me is from Shakespeare's *Sonnet 18*. The line is, **“Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?”** It's the opening line of the sonnet, and it's one of the most famous lines in English literature. The poem itself is a beautiful tribute(致敬) to the timeless beauty of a loved one, and this line sets the tone for the entire piece.
>
> I first came across this poem in high school during an English literature class. We were studying Shakespeare, and our teacher had us analyze several of his sonnets. This one stood out to me because of its ==romantic and poetic language==. I remember being struck by how simple yet profound the opening line was. It immediately draws you in and makes you curious about what the comparison will be.
>
> The reason this line resonates with me so much is because of its ==elegance and universality==. It's a question that feels both personal and timeless as if Shakespeare is speaking directly to the reader. ==I also love how it captures the fleeting beauty of summer and contrasts it with the eternal beauty of the person he's describing==. It's a reminder of how powerful words can be in expressing emotions and ideas.
>
> Whenever I think of this line, I feel a sense of admiration for Shakespeare's ability to convey such deep feelings in just a few words. It also makes me appreciate the beauty of poetry and how it can connect people across time and cultures. Even though the poem was written centuries ago, its message still feels relevant and moving today.

**1. Are you good at memorizing things?**
I would say I'm fairly good at memorizing things, especially if they interest me or if I can connect them to something meaningful. For example, I find it easier to remember lyrics to songs I enjoy or facts related to topics I'm passionate about. However, I struggle with memorizing random or abstract information unless I use techniques like repetition, visualization, or creating associations. Overall, my ability to memorize depends on the context and how much effort I put into it.

**2. Do you think children would like the rhythm of songs or poems? Why?**
Yes, I think children are naturally drawn to the rhythm of songs and poems because it makes the content more engaging and fun. The repetitive and melodic nature of rhymes and rhythms helps capture their attention and makes it easier for them to remember the words. For example, nursery rhymes or children's songs often use simple, catchy patterns that appeal to young listeners. Additionally, the rhythm adds an element of playfulness, which aligns with children's love for creativity and imagination.

**3. Do you think it is easier for children to learn a song or poem than adults? Why?**
Yes, I believe it's generally easier for children to learn songs or poems compared to adults. Children have a more flexible and receptive mind, which allows them to absorb new information quickly. They are also less self-conscious and more willing to engage with creative and repetitive activities, which aids memorization. On the other hand, adults might overthink or struggle to find time to practice due to their busy schedules. However, adults who are motivated or have a strong interest in music or poetry can still learn effectively.

**4. What can people learn from songs or poems?**
People can learn a great deal from songs and poems, as they often convey emotions, stories, and cultural values. For example, songs and poems can teach us about history, traditions, and social issues, providing insights into different perspectives and experiences. They also help improve language skills, such as vocabulary, pronunciation, and rhythm. Additionally, songs and poems can inspire creativity, empathy, and self-expression, allowing people to connect with their own emotions and those of others. Overall, they are powerful tools for both education and personal growth.

>
> ==Originally==, my plan was to start looking for a job right after graduation. I had already begun preparing my resume and researching companies in my field. However, last month, I attended a seminar about studying abroad, and it completely changed my perspective. The speaker shared their experiences of studying overseas, and I realized how much it could ==broaden my horizons, both academically and personally==. After giving it some serious thought, I decided to change my plan and ==pursue a master's degree abroad== instead of entering the job market immediately.
>
> The new plan involves applying to universities in countries like the UK or Canada, which are known for their excellent programs in my field. I've started preparing for language tests like IELTS and researching scholarships to fund my studies. It's a big shift from my original plan, but I feel it's the right decision for my long-term growth.
>
> At first, I felt a bit ==anxious== about the change because it meant ==stepping out of my comfort zone and delaying my entry into the workforce==.

I believe this change will ==open up more opportunities== for me in the future, and I'm looking forward to the challenges and experiences that come with studying in a different country.

**1. Do people often change their plans?**
Yes, people often change their plans due to various reasons. Sometimes, unexpected circumstances like bad weather, illness, or work emergencies can force them to adjust their schedules. Other times, people might change their plans because they find better alternatives or simply change their minds. For example, someone might decide to stay home instead of going out if they feel tired or if a more appealing opportunity arises. Flexibility is a natural part of life, and adapting to changes is essential for managing priorities effectively.

**2. Would you tell others if you change your plan?**
Yes, but only to those who are directly affected by the change or are important to me. For instance, if I cancel a meeting with a friend, I would inform them immediately to avoid inconvenience. Similarly, if I change plans that involve family or colleagues, I would let them know as soon as possible. However, for plans that don't impact others, I might not feel the need to share the change. Communication is key to maintaining trust and ensuring that everyone is ==on the same page==.

**3. Why do you think parents still make plans for their children nowadays?**
Parents often make plans for their children because they want to ensure their well-being and success. For example, they might plan their education, extracurricular activities, or even future careers to provide them with the best opportunities. Parents also make plans to instill discipline and structure in their children's lives, which they believe will help them grow into responsible adults. Additionally, some parents might feel that their experience and knowledge can guide their children in making better decisions, especially in a competitive and fast-changing world.

**4. How does technology help people make plans?**
Technology plays a significant role in helping people make and manage plans efficiently. For instance, calendar apps and reminder tools allow individuals to organize their schedules, set deadlines, and receive notifications about upcoming events. Communication platforms like email or messaging apps make it easy to coordinate plans with others, even across long distances.

It keeps our home cool and comfortable, making it possible to ==relax and sleep without feeling overwhelmed by the heat==. Similarly, during the winter, when it gets uncomfortably cold, we use the air conditioner to maintain a warm and cozy indoor environment. Even though we don’t use it year-round, it’s during these seasons that we truly appreciate its value.
>
> The air conditioner is important to us for several reasons. First, it significantly ==improves our quality of life== by keeping our home at a comfortable temperature during extreme weather. Second, it helps us ==stay productive==, as it’s difficult to focus on work or studies when it’s too hot or too cold. Lastly, it contributes to our health by reducing the risk of heat-related illnesses in the summer and keeping us warm during the winter, which is particularly important for my grandparents, who live with us and are more sensitive to temperature changes.

>
> The Oriental Pearl TV Tower is a unique and futuristic-looking building. It's incredibly tall, standing at 468 meters, and its design is inspired by a poem about pearls falling onto a jade plate. The tower consists of several large spheres at different levels, connected by vertical columns, which give it a distinctive and elegant appearance. At night, the tower is illuminated with colorful lights, making it even more striking and visually appealing.
>

Additionally, the tower houses a museum dedicated to the history of Shanghai, which adds an educational element to its appeal.

It's a must-see for anyone visiting Shanghai, and it never fails to leave a lasting impression.

**1. What types of buildings are popular in your country? **
In China, ancient buildings are highly popular and admired for their cultural and historical significance. Traditional Chinese architecture, such as palaces, temples, and courtyard homes, reflects the country's rich heritage. For example, the Forbidden City in Beijing and the ancient water towns in Suzhou are iconic examples of Chinese architecture, featuring intricate designs, wooden structures, and symbolic elements like curved roofs and dragon motifs. These buildings are not only tourist attractions but also serve as a reminder of China's artistic and engineering achievements throughout history.

**2. Is it worth spending a lot of money on the exterior appearance of a building?**
Spending money on the exterior appearance of a building can be worth it, depending on the purpose and context. For iconic structures like museums, government buildings, or cultural landmarks, an impressive exterior can enhance their significance and attract visitors. However, for residential or functional buildings, it's more important to balance aesthetics with practicality and cost-effectiveness. While a visually appealing exterior can create a positive impression, the focus should also be on ==durability, sustainability, and the building's overall functionality==.

**3. Is it more important for a building to look good on the outside or on the inside?**
I believe the inside of a building is more important than the outside because it directly impacts the comfort and usability of the space. A well-designed interior ensures that the building meets the needs of its occupants, whether it's for living, working, or leisure. For example, good lighting, ventilation, and layout are essential for creating a functional and pleasant environment. That said, the exterior appearance is also important, as it contributes to the building's identity and can influence people's perceptions. Ideally, a balance between the two should be achieved.

**4. Why do people like to visit historical sites?**
People visit historical sites for various reasons. Firstly, these sites offer a glimpse into the past, allowing visitors to learn about history, culture, and traditions. For example, exploring ancient ruins or castles can provide insights into how people lived centuries ago. Secondly, historical sites often have ==unique architectural and artistic value==, making them visually captivating. Additionally, visiting such places can ==evoke a sense of connection to one's heritage== or inspire awe at human achievements. Lastly, historical sites are often surrounded by stories and legends, which add an element of intrigue and fascination.

**1. Is it beneficial to insert advertisements within a TV series?**
Inserting advertisements within a TV series can be beneficial for broadcasters and advertisers, but it often disrupts the viewing experience for the audience. For broadcasters, ads generate revenue, which helps fund the production of high-quality content. Advertisers also benefit by reaching a large and engaged audience. However, for viewers, frequent ad breaks can be frustrating, especially during intense or emotional scenes. While ads are necessary for the industry, finding a balance between commercial interests and viewer satisfaction is crucial.

**2. Do you think that parents should limit their children from watching television?**
Yes, I believe parents should limit their children's television time to ensure a healthy balance between screen time and other activities. Excessive TV watching can lead to issues like reduced physical activity, poor sleep quality, and exposure to inappropriate content. However, television can also be educational if children watch age-appropriate programs that stimulate their curiosity and learning. Parents should set reasonable limits and encourage alternative activities, such as reading, playing outdoors, or engaging in creative hobbies, to promote overall development.

**3. Would your family watch TV together?**
Yes, my family occasionally watches TV together, especially during special occasions or when there's a program that interests everyone. For example, we might watch a popular reality show, a sports event, or a movie during weekends or holidays. Watching TV together provides an opportunity for bonding and shared enjoyment. However, due to busy schedules and differing preferences, it's not something we do every day. When we do, it's a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend quality time as a family.

**4. What are the differences in television viewing habits between the elderly and young people?**
There are significant differences in television viewing habits between the elderly and young people. Elderly individuals often prefer traditional TV channels and watch programs like news, dramas, or documentaries at scheduled times. They tend to value the routine and familiarity of linear TV. On the other hand, young people are more likely to use streaming platforms like BiliBili or YouTube, where they can watch content on demand and binge-watch entire series. They also prefer genres like reality shows, comedies, or online videos, reflecting their desire for convenience and entertainment tailored to their interests.

**5. How has technology changed the way people watch television?**
Technology has revolutionized the way people watch television by introducing on-demand streaming, personalized content, and multi-device accessibility. Platforms like iQIYI and youku allow viewers to watch their favorite shows anytime, anywhere, without being tied to a TV schedule. Smart TVs and devices like Roku or Chromecast have made it easier to access a wide range of content. Additionally, social media and recommendation algorithms help users discover new shows based on their preferences. Overall, technology has made television viewing more flexible, interactive, and user-centric.

It's rare to find someone who is so genuine and selfless, and I truly value the trust and connection we've built over the years. Annie's sharing has made a positive impact on my life, and I'm lucky to have her as a friend.

**1. What kinds of emotional support do people need at work?**
People need various types of emotional support at work to maintain their well-being and productivity. For example, they might need encouragement and recognition for their efforts, especially during challenging projects or stressful periods. A supportive work environment where colleagues and managers listen to their concerns and offer constructive feedback is also crucial. Additionally, flexibility and understanding during personal difficulties, such as family issues or health problems, can make a significant difference. Emotional support helps employees feel valued, motivated, and less overwhelmed, which ultimately benefits both the individual and the organization.

**2. Would you share your feelings with your coworkers?**
It depends on the situation and the level of trust I have with my coworkers. If I'm close to them and feel comfortable, I might share my feelings, especially if it's related to work stress or a collaborative project. However, I would be cautious about oversharing personal emotions, as maintaining professionalism is important in the workplace. In general, I believe open communication can strengthen teamwork and create a supportive atmosphere, but it's essential to strike a balance and respect boundaries.

**3. Is it possible to know a job applicant's emotional resilience through the recruiting process?**
Yes, to some extent, it is possible to assess a job applicant's emotional resilience during the recruiting process. For example, behavioral interview questions that ask about past challenges and how they were handled can provide insights into their ability to cope with stress and adversity. Additionally, situational judgment tests or role-playing exercises can reveal how candidates manage pressure and solve problems in real-time. However, emotional resilience is complex and may not be fully understood until the person is actually in the role and facing day-to-day challenges.

>
>  In terms of difficulty, I'd say **it can vary**. Some Sudoku puzzles are relatively easy, especially the ones labeled as "easy" in newspapers or apps, and you can solve them in about 10 to 20 minutes. But others, especially the more advanced ones, can be quite challenging, requiring an hour or more. For those hard ones, I might take my time, sometimes even revisiting the puzzle later if I get stuck.

So overall, I feel a lot of satisfaction from solving Sudoku puzzles, and it's a good way to unwind after a busy day.

**1. Which do you think is better? A detective movie or its original novel?**
I think it depends on personal preference, but I would argue that the original novel is often better. Novels allow readers to immerse themselves in the story, explore the characters'  thoughts and motivations, and use their imagination to visualize the scenes. Detective novels, in particular, often include intricate details and clues that can be more engaging when read at one's own pace. However, detective movies can also be enjoyable because they bring the story to life with visuals, sound, and acting, making the experience more dynamic and accessible.

**2. Why are detective stories attractive to people?**
Detective stories are attractive because they stimulate curiosity and engage the mind. People enjoy the challenge of solving mysteries alongside the characters, piecing together clues, and trying to predict the outcome before it's revealed. The suspense and tension in these stories create a thrilling experience that keeps readers or viewers hooked. Additionally, detective stories often explore themes of justice, morality, and human psychology, which add depth and make them intellectually and emotionally rewarding.

**3. What kinds of puzzles improve people's intelligence?**
Puzzles like crosswords, Sudoku, and logic games are great for improving intelligence because they enhance problem-solving skills, memory, and critical thinking. Jigsaw puzzles can improve spatial awareness and patience, while riddles and brain teasers encourage creative thinking and mental flexibility. Strategy-based puzzles, such as chess or escape room challenges, also help develop planning and decision-making abilities. These activities stimulate different parts of the brain, making them effective tools for cognitive development.

**4. Why do parents let their children play puzzles?**
Parents encourage their children to play puzzles because they are both fun and educational. Puzzles help children develop essential skills like problem-solving, hand-eye coordination, and concentration. They also teach patience and perseverance, as children learn to work through challenges step by step. Additionally, puzzles can be a great way for children to bond with family members or friends, fostering social skills and teamwork. Overall, puzzles are a valuable tool for promoting cognitive and emotional growth in a playful and engaging way.

**5. How can technology and intellectual games be combined better?**
Technology and intellectual games can be combined better by creating interactive and immersive experiences. For example, mobile apps and online platforms can offer personalized puzzles and games that adapt to the user's skill level, making them more engaging and effective. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) can also be used to create realistic and challenging environments for problem-solving and strategy games. Additionally, incorporating elements like gamification, where users earn rewards or compete with others, can motivate people to engage more deeply with intellectual games.

**6. Does the government need to take steps to boost the development of intellectual games?**
Yes, I believe the government should support the development of intellectual games because they have significant educational and social benefits. Funding research and innovation in this field can lead to the creation of more effective and accessible games that promote cognitive development and lifelong learning. The government could also encourage schools to incorporate intellectual games into their curricula to enhance students'  critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, organizing public events or competitions centered around intellectual games can raise awareness and make them more popular among people of all ages.

**1. Is sports important for children?**

Yes, I believe sports are incredibly important for children, both physically and mentally. On the physical side, sports help children build strength, improve their coordination, and develop healthy habits that can last a lifetime. Regular physical activity also reduces the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Mentally, sports can teach children essential life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Additionally, participating in sports can boost their self-confidence and help them manage stress. In today's digital age, where many children spend excessive time on screens, engaging in sports is even more crucial to ensure they stay active and healthy.

**2. How can we make children aware of the importance of sports?**

There are several ways we can make children aware of the importance of sports. First, schools and parents can play a significant role by encouraging participation in physical activities from a young age. For instance, schools could offer a wide variety of sports programs so children can find something they enjoy. Additionally, parents should lead by example by engaging in sports themselves, which would inspire their children to do the same. Media campaigns and advertisements promoting the benefits of sports can also be effective, especially when they target children and highlight role models who excel in sports. Finally, creating a positive and supportive environment where children are celebrated for their effort, rather than just their achievements, can motivate them to continue being active.

> In short, my uncle is someone who truly cares about the environment, and I really ==look up to him== for that.

**1. Why can recycling help the environment?**

Recycling can help the environment in several ways. First, it reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators, which helps minimize pollution and conserve space. By reusing materials like paper, plastic, and metal, we can also reduce the need to extract raw resources, which is often harmful to ecosystems. Additionally, recycling reduces energy consumption, as processing recycled materials generally uses less energy compared to manufacturing products from virgin materials. This, in turn, helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Overall, recycling plays a crucial role in promoting a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle.

**2. What have people done to damage the environment?**

Unfortunately, humans have done a lot to damage the environment over the years. One of the main ways we've harmed the environment is through deforestation, where vast areas of trees are cut down for agriculture, urbanization, or logging. This disrupts ecosystems, contributes to the loss of biodiversity, and accelerates climate change. Another major issue is pollution, whether it's air pollution from industrial activities, plastic pollution in the oceans, or chemical runoff into rivers and lakes. The overuse of fossil fuels has also led to the depletion of natural resources and increased carbon emissions, driving global warming. Additionally, overfishing and the destruction of habitats are contributing to the decline in wildlife populations.

**3. Do you think technology can improve environment-related problems?**

Yes, technology can definitely play a role in solving many environment-related problems. For example, renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, which would lower greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of pollution, advances in waste management and recycling technologies can help reduce the environmental impact of plastic and other materials. Moreover, technologies like electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances can reduce carbon footprints. On a larger scale, environmental monitoring systems powered by technology can help track pollution levels and predict environmental changes, allowing us to take proactive measures. However, while technology can offer solutions, it's important that these innovations are used alongside sustainable practices and policies.

**4. Is it important to teach students environmental protection at school?**

Yes, it's incredibly important to teach students about environmental protection at school. Educating children about environmental issues not only raises awareness but also empowers them to make sustainable choices as they grow older. Schools are an ideal place to instill values of environmental responsibility because they can influence students from a young age. By learning about climate change, recycling, and conservation, students can understand the long-term effects of human activities on the planet. Moreover, when students are educated on these issues, they are more likely to adopt eco-friendly habits, encourage others to do the same, and even advocate for policies that protect the environment in the future.

Describe a newly enacted law that you like but you want to change part of it

You should say:

When it was enacted

What the law is about

Which part you want to change

And explain why you want to change the part

>  I’d like to talk about a new law in my country that bans single-use plastics, like plastic bags and straws. I think it’s a great law because it helps reduce plastic waste, which is a huge problem for the environment.
>
>  The law requires businesses to stop using single-use plastics and switch to more eco-friendly alternatives, like paper or ==reusable materials==. This is fantastic because it encourages people to ==be more mindful of== their waste and helps protect oceans and wildlife from plastic pollution. I’ve already noticed fewer plastic bags in stores, and it feels good to see people using reusable bags instead.
>
>  However, there’s one part of the law I’d like to change. Right now, the alternatives to plastic, like paper straws or reusable bags, are more expensive for small businesses and customers. This can be a problem for people with lower incomes or small shops that can’t afford the switch. I think the government should provide ==subsidies or discounts== to help businesses and individuals ==make the transition== easier. That way, everyone can afford to follow the law without feeling the financial pressure.
>
>  Overall, I really support this law because ==it’s a big step toward a cleaner environment==. But if they could make it more affordable for everyone, I think it would be even better and more effective.

**1. Why is law important?**

Law is essential because it provides structure and order within society. It establishes clear guidelines for acceptable behavior, helping to prevent chaos and conflict. Laws protect individual rights, such as personal freedom, property, and security, ensuring that people can live in a safe and fair environment. Without law, there would be no system to resolve disputes or punish wrongdoers, which could lead to injustice and inequality. Additionally, laws play a crucial role in maintaining social harmony by setting out rules for how people should interact with each other. In a broader sense, they also help safeguard public health, the environment, and the economy by regulating industries and promoting fairness in business practices.

**2. Why are there people who like a law but want to change part of it?**

There are often people who appreciate the overall principles of a law but believe certain aspects of it need improvement. This can happen because laws are designed to address a wide range of issues, but they may not always be perfectly suited to every situation. Over time, social values, technology, and circumstances change, and laws that were once appropriate may no longer align with current needs or perspectives. For example, a law that works well in one context might be seen as outdated or unjust in another. People may want to change parts of a law if they feel it's unfair, too restrictive, or if they think it could be more effective in achieving its intended goals. In a democratic society, it's normal for people to question and challenge laws in order to make the system more just and equitable for everyone.

Describe a live performance you enjoyed watching

You should say:

Who performed in it

What kind of performance it was

When you watched it

And explain why you enjoyed watching it

> I’d like to talk about a live performance of the musical *Romeo and Juliet* that I watched last year. It was an amazing experience, and I still remember it clearly.
>
> The performance was ==put on== by a famous international theater company, and the actors were incredibly talented. The two leads who played Romeo and Juliet had such ==powerful voices and great acting skills==—they really made the characters ==come alive==. The rest of the cast was fantastic too, and everyone worked so well together that the whole performance felt ==real and emotional==.
>
> The musical was a modern version of Shakespeare’s classic story, mixing old and new styles. The songs were beautiful, with some slow, emotional ones and others that were full of energy. The dancing was also really impressive, and the stage design and lighting made it feel like we were actually in Verona, the setting of the story.
>
> I went to see it with my friends during a weekend. We’d been excited about it for weeks, and it didn’t disappoint. The music, acting, and overall production were so good that it made the whole evening unforgettable.
>
> What I loved most was how the performance made the story’s themes of love, conflict, and fate feel so modern and relatable. The actors were so talented, and the whole experience was so well put together that it left a deep impression on me. It was one of those rare moments where everything—the music, the acting, and the atmosphere—just clicked, and I left the theater feeling inspired and moved.

**1. What kind of party have you had so far?**
So far, I've had a few birthday parties, which were quite memorable. For example, on my 18th birthday, my friends and family organized a surprise party for me, complete with decorations, cake, and games. It was a mix of laughter, music, and heartfelt moments. I've also attended graduation parties and casual get-togethers with friends, but birthday parties stand out because they are personal and celebratory, ==marking special milestones in life==.

**2. Do you think it is hard for people to perform in front of their friends?**
Yes, I think performing in front of friends can be challenging for many people because ==there's added pressure to impress or meet their expectations==. Friends are often familiar with your personality and abilities, which can make you feel more self-conscious about making mistakes. However, for some, performing in front of friends can also be easier because they feel more supported and encouraged by people they trust. It really depends on the individual's confidence and the nature of their relationship with their friends.

**3. Is it easy to invite your friends to attend your party or your performance?**
It's usually easy to invite friends to a party or performance, especially if they are close to you and share similar interests. Most friends are happy to support you and enjoy the occasion together. However, it can sometimes be challenging if they have prior commitments or if the event requires a lot of time or effort. Clear communication and giving them enough notice can make the process smoother and increase the likelihood of their attendance.

**4. Is it expensive to watch a live performance in your country?**
The cost of watching a live performance in my country varies ==depending on the type of event and the venue==（活动场地）. For example, concerts by international artists or large-scale theater productions can be quite expensive, with ticket prices ranging from moderate to very high. On the other hand, local performances, such as community theater or smaller music gigs, are often more affordable. While some live performances can be costly, many people feel the experience is worth the price because of the unique atmosphere and connection with the performers.

**5. Why do many people prefer to watch a live performance rather than watch it on TV?**
Many people prefer live performances because they ==offer a unique and immersive experience== that can't be replicated on TV. The energy of the crowd, the interaction with performers, and the spontaneity of live events create a sense of excitement and connection. For example, at a concert, the music feels more powerful, and you can see the artists'  emotions and efforts up close. Additionally, live performances often feel more ==authentic and memorable==, making them a special experience that people are willing to pay for and cherish.

**1. Do you think it is very important for students to do sports?**
Yes, I believe it is very important for students to participate in sports. Engaging in physical activities not only improves their physical health but also enhances mental well-being. For example, sports help reduce stress, boost concentration, and promote teamwork and leadership skills. Additionally, ==regular exercise can instill discipline and time management==, as students learn to balance academics and extracurricular activities. Overall, sports play a vital role in the holistic development of students, preparing them for challenges both inside and outside the classroom.

**2. Does winning in a sports game make students feel proud?**
Yes, winning in a sports game often makes students feel proud because it ==validates their hard work, skills, and teamwork==. The sense of achievement and recognition they receive from winning can ==boost their confidence and motivation==.

**3. Do you think winning is everything in sports competitions?**
No, I don’t think winning is everything in sports competitions. While winning can be rewarding, the true value of sports lies in ==the lessons learned through participation==, such as teamwork, perseverance, and discipline. For instance, losing a game can teach students how to handle failure gracefully and strive for improvement. Additionally, sports foster friendships, physical fitness, and a sense of community, which are equally important.

> I’d like to talk about last weekend when I had a free day off from school and decided to spend it visiting West Lake, which is conveniently located near my campus. It was a relaxing and memorable afternoon, and I really enjoyed the break from my usual routine.
>
> Since West Lake is just a short metro ride away, my roommate and I didn’t need to wake up early or rush. We left in the early afternoon and arrived at the lake in no time. The weather was perfect—sunny with a cool breeze—and the atmosphere around the lake was peaceful and inviting. We spent the first part of the afternoon strolling along the lakeside, taking in the stunning views of the water, willow trees, and distant mountains. The scenery was so beautiful that we couldn’t resist taking lots of photos to capture the moment.
>
> As the sun began to set, we found a quiet spot by the lake to sit and watch the sunset. The sky turned into a mix of orange, pink, and purple hues, reflecting on the water, and it was truly breathtaking. It felt like a scene from a painting, and I remember feeling completely at peace while enjoying the view. My roommate and I chatted about life, school, and our future plans, which made the experience even more special.
>
> After the sunset, we explored the nearby shopping area, which is a blend of traditional and modern styles. We wandered through some local shops, bought a few souvenirs, and even tried some famous Hangzhou snacks, like *dongpo pork* and *longjing tea*. It was a leisurely way to end the day, and we didn’t feel rushed at all.

Spending time with my roommate in such a serene setting helped me unwind and forget about the stress of schoolwork. By the end of the day, I felt refreshed and grateful for the simple yet meaningful experience. It reminded me how important it is to take breaks and appreciate the little things in life.

**1. Do people nowadays have more free time than in the past?** 
It’s ==debatable== whether people today have more free time than in the past. On one hand, advancements in technology and automation have reduced the time needed for many tasks, such as household chores or commuting. On the other hand, the fast-paced nature of modern life, with its demanding work schedules and constant connectivity, often leaves people feeling busier than ever. While some may have more free time in theory, they might struggle to use it effectively due to stress or distractions like social media.

**2. Do you think most people are able to manage their free time well?** 
I think many people struggle to manage their free time effectively. With so many distractions, such as smartphones, social media, and streaming platforms, it’s easy to waste time without realizing it. Additionally, some people find it hard to balance work, family, and personal interests, leading to poor time management. However, those who prioritize planning and self-discipline, such as setting goals or using time management tools, are often more successful in making the most of their free time.

**3. What do people like to do when they are free in your country?** 
In my country, people enjoy a variety of activities during their free time. Many prefer relaxing at home, watching TV shows, or browsing social media. Others engage in outdoor activities like hiking, playing sports, or visiting parks. Socializing with friends and family over meals or coffee is also popular. Additionally, some people use their free time for hobbies like reading, painting, or gardening. Younger generations often spend time playing video games or exploring new trends online.

**4. What's the difference between the things people did in their free time in the past and the things they do nowadays?** 
In the past, people’s free time activities were often more ==community-oriented and physically engaging==. For example, they might gather for local festivals, play traditional games, or spend time outdoors. Nowadays, technology has transformed how people spend their free time, with many opting for ==screen-based activities== like watching movies, playing video games, or scrolling through social media. While these activities are convenient, they are often more solitary and less physically active compared to the past.

**5. Why is working extra hours common nowadays?** 
Working extra hours has become common due to several factors. Firstly, the competitive job market pushes employees to work harder to secure their positions or advance their careers. Secondly, the rise of technology means people are constantly connected to their work, making it harder to “switch off.” Additionally, some industries have ==high workloads or tight deadlines==, requiring employees to put in extra hours. Lastly, financial pressures, such as rising living costs, often force people to take on more work to make ends meet.

**6. What can we do to stop working long hours?** 
To reduce long working hours, both individuals and organizations need to take action. Employers can promote a healthier work-life balance by setting clear boundaries, encouraging breaks, and offering flexible work arrangements. Employees should prioritize time management, set realistic goals, and learn to say no to excessive demands. Governments can also play a role by ==enforcing labor laws== that limit working hours and protect employees’ rights. Ultimately, fostering a culture that values productivity over long hours is key to addressing this issue.

People enjoy visiting places with trees or forests because these environments offer a sense of peace, relaxation, and connection to nature. Forests provide a break from the noise and stress of urban life, allowing visitors to unwind and recharge. The fresh air, natural beauty, and soothing sounds of rustling leaves or birdsong create a calming atmosphere.

Describe an interesting discussion you had with your friend

You should say:

What the discussion was about

What opinions you and your friend had

Why you think the discussion was interesting

And how you felt about it

>  One interesting discussion I had with my best friend took place in secondary school. It was a spontaneous conversation we had one afternoon while we were walking around the playground, just enjoying the fresh air and chatting. The topic of our discussion was “predicting the future”, which might sound a bit strange, but at the time, it felt like such a thought-provoking subject that we'd never really discussed before.
>
>  The conversation started when I casually mentioned that I thought I had the ability to predict my own future, at least in the short term. This might seem a bit odd, but what I meant was that I had a clear idea of what was going to happen on a daily basis. I knew my class schedule, when I would have breaks, what homework I needed to do, and even which teacher would be teaching each subject. To me, this gave me a sense of predicting the flow of my day, almost as if I could foresee every detail of the next few hours.
>
>  However, my best friend didn't agree with me at all. She argued that true prediction had to **go beyond just routine events** and needed to involve a deeper understanding of life, people, and the world around us. To her, predicting the future meant understanding things like global events, personal relationships, or even life-changing decisions—things that weren't just a matter of knowing a schedule or plan.
>
>  As we continued our discussion, I found it really interesting to hear her point of view. She started to tell me that some people, like scientists or philosophers, might be able to predict things based on data and research, but she felt that true prediction required more than just logical reasoning. It had to involve a kind of intuition or foresight that went beyond the rational understanding of the present. Though we had very different ideas about what it meant to predict the future, we recognized that both views could be valid in their way.
>
>  What made this discussion so fascinating was that we both tried to make sense of something that seemed very abstract. We didn't come to any conclusions, but the conversation **sparked a deeper interest in how we think about time, destiny, and control over our lives**. It made me realize that predicting the future is not as simple as I once thought—it involves many layers of thinking, from knowing our routines to trying to understand bigger life events.
>
>  After that day, I found myself thinking a lot about how we define the future and whether we have control over it, or if it's something entirely beyond our understanding. We still talk about similar topics now, but that walk around the playground remains one of the most interesting and thought-provoking conversations we've had.

**1. When do children normally form their own views?**

Children begin forming their own views around the age of 3 or 4, but their opinions become more defined as they grow older, especially during adolescence. By around 10 to 12 years old, children ==develop a clearer sense of identity== and are more capable of forming independent opinions on social or moral issues.

**2. Do children have strong opinions?**

Yes, as children grow, especially ==during their teenage years==, they often develop strong opinions on various topics like fairness, social issues, or politics. While their views might not always be fully informed, they can still be passionate and firm about them.

**3. Should parents request their kids to obey them?**

Parents should ask their children to obey rules for safety and discipline, but it's important to balance this with encouraging open communication. When children ==understand why rules are in place==, they're more likely to respect them and develop a sense of responsibility.

**4. In what industries do you think communication is a necessary skill?**

Communication is crucial in many industries, particularly healthcare, education, customer service, and business. In each of these fields, clear communication ensures ==effective collaboration, problem-solving, and customer satisfaction, as well as smooth operation and safety.==

**5. Should parents consider their children's opinions on everything? Why?**

Parents should consider their children's opinions, especially as they grow older, to promote independence and mutual respect. However, some decisions, like those involving safety or well-being, may need to be made by parents. It's about finding a healthy balance between guidance and listening.

**6. Why do some young people refuse to communicate with others?**

Some young people avoid communication due to ==social anxiety, shyness,== or past negative experiences like bullying. Others may feel misunderstood or simply ==prefer solitude==, especially if they are introverted. A supportive environment can help them feel more comfortable opening up.

#### （2）童年玩具

Describe a toy you liked in your childhood

You should say

What kind of toy it is

When you received it

How you played it

And how you felt about it

>  One toy I absolutely loved as a child was a dragon doll. I can still remember how excited I was when I first got it, as I had always been fascinated by dragons ever since I was little. I think my love for dragons started from reading fairy tales and watching animated movies where these mythical creatures were portrayed as **powerful and majestic beings**. So, when I got the dragon doll, it felt like I finally had my own little piece of the fantasy world.
>
> The dragon doll itself was quite special. It was a vibrant green color, with golden wings that shimmered when the light hit them. The body was **soft and plush**, but the wings and tail had a slightly stiffer texture, which made them stand out. It also had bright, sparkling eyes that gave it a very lifelike appearance, almost as though ==it could come to life at any moment==. I used to spend hours playing with it, imagining all sorts of adventures where my dragon would fly through the skies and protect me from imaginary villains（坏人）.
>
> What made this toy even more memorable for me was **the sense of wonder and creativity it sparked**. I didn't just play with it as a regular doll. I created entire worlds and stories around it, and it became a companion during many of my childhood games. It helped me develop my imagination and storytelling skills, as I would invent elaborate scenarios and scenarios involving my dragon. It also made me feel like I could escape into a fantasy realm whenever I wanted, which was something I really valued as a child.
>
> Though I've grown up now and no longer play with the doll, I still **keep it tucked away** in a box as a reminder of my childhood and the magical adventures I had with it. It's not just a toy to me anymore; it's a symbol of the creativity and imagination that shaped a lot of my early years. It helped me dream big and created a sense of magic in my everyday life, which is something I will always treasure.

**1. How do advertisements influence children?**
Advertisements influence children by ==shaping their preferences==, desires, and even behaviors. For example, ads for toys, snacks, or games often ==use bright colors, catchy jingles, and popular characters to grab children's attention==. This can lead to children pestering their parents to buy the advertised products. Additionally, advertisements can create unrealistic expectations or promote materialism, making children believe they need certain items to be happy or fit in with their peers. Over time, this can affect their values and spending habits as they grow older.

**2. Should advertising aimed at kids be prohibited?**
I believe advertising aimed at kids should be ==regulated==, if not entirely prohibited. Children are highly ==impressionable== and may not have the critical thinking skills to understand the persuasive intent behind ads. This can lead to unhealthy consumption patterns, such as demanding sugary snacks or expensive toys. However, instead of a complete ban, stricter guidelines could be implemented to ensure ads promote positive messages, such as education or healthy habits. This way, children are protected without completely eliminating advertising.

**3. Do you think parents should buy more toys for their kids or spend more time with them?**
I think spending more time with children is far more important than buying them toys. While toys can be entertaining and educational, they cannot replace the emotional connection and guidance that come from quality time with parents. Playing, talking, or engaging in activities together helps children ==develop social skills, confidence, and a sense of security==. Toys might keep children occupied temporarily, but the memories and lessons from time spent with parents have a lasting impact on their development.

**4. What's the difference between the toys kids play now and those they played in the past?**
The main difference between modern toys and those from the past is ==the level of technology and interactivity==. Today's toys often include electronic components, such as lights, sounds, or apps, which make them more engaging but also more complex. In the past, toys were simpler and often made from natural materials like wood or fabric. They encouraged imaginative play and creativity, such as building blocks or dolls. While modern toys can be educational, they sometimes rely too much on pre-programmed features, leaving less room for creativity.

**5. What's the difference between the toys boys play with and girls play with?**
Traditionally, toys for boys and girls have been divided along gender lines, with boys encouraged to play with ==action figures, cars, or construction sets==, while girls are given ==dolls, kitchen sets, or dress-up kits==. These differences often reflect societal stereotypes about gender roles. However, this trend is gradually changing as more parents and educators encourage children to play with a variety of toys, regardless of gender. This shift helps children develop a wider range of skills and interests, breaking away from outdated norms.

**6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of modern toys?**
Modern toys have several advantages, such as being more interactive and educational. Many toys are designed to teach children coding, problem-solving, or other skills through games and activities. They also often feature advanced technology, like augmented reality, which can make learning fun and engaging. However, there are disadvantages too. Modern toys can be expensive and may require batteries or screens, which can limit imaginative play. Additionally, some toys may overstimulate children or discourage physical activity, leading to concerns about health and creativity.

She's not only well-traveled but also very knowledgeable, so when she speaks about her experiences, I always feel like I'm learning something new and valuable. I really admire her curiosity about the world and her open-minded approach to life.
>
> Interestingly, we also **share a lot of common interests**. We both love painting, especially watercolor, and we often spend time together working on our paintings. I think it's great to have a neighbor who has similar hobbies, as it makes it easier to connect and share ideas. Additionally, Mrs. Li is very into yoga, and though I'm not as experienced as she is, she's always encouraging me to try new poses or attend local classes.
>
> What I truly appreciate about Mrs. Li, though, is how non-pretentious she is. It's rare to meet someone with so much life experience who remains so humble and unassuming. She never makes conversations about herself, which is refreshing because sometimes people who have done a lot in life can become a bit arrogant or self-centered. But Mrs. Li is always interested in what I have to say and makes me feel heard.
>
> In short, she's an inspiring, thoughtful, and kind person, and I feel really fortunate to have her as a neighbor. Our chats are something I look forward to, and I'm always learning from her, whether it's about life, travel, or art.

#### （4）提高注意力

Describe something you do that can help you concentrate on work/study

You should say:

What it is

How it helps you concentrate

When you do it

And explain how you feel about it

>  I'd like to talk about a **technique** that has really helped me stay focused during my studies, and that's using the **Pomodoro Technique**. It might sound simple, but it has had a huge impact on my productivity. Essentially, this method involves breaking down my study time into **25-minute intervals**, known as 'Pomodoros', followed by a short 5-minute break. After four cycles, I take a longer break, usually around 15 to 20 minutes.
>
> I discovered this technique a couple of years ago when I was struggling to stay concentrated while preparing for a major exam. I noticed that whenever I tried to study for long hours without breaks, my mind would start wandering, and I would become easily distracted. However, once I started using the Pomodoro Technique, it was like **a game-changer** for me. Knowing that I only have to focus for 25 minutes at a time makes the task seem more **manageable**, and the short breaks help me recharge mentally.
>
> What I find particularly effective about this method is that it helps me maintain a **high level of focus** during those short bursts of time. I often turn off my phone and eliminate any distractions during each session. Surprisingly, I can accomplish much more in those concentrated intervals than when I try to study for hours on end without a clear structure. The breaks also prevent me from feeling burnt out, allowing me to sustain my energy levels throughout the day.
>
> Besides, the Pomodoro Technique helps me **stay motivated** because it adds a sense of urgency. I try to challenge myself to complete a specific task before the timer runs out, which keeps me engaged. Additionally, after a few cycles, I reward myself with something small, like a cup of coffee or some snacks, which helps me stay refreshed and ready to continue.
>
> In conclusion, this simple yet effective technique has greatly improved my ability to concentrate and manage my time efficiently. It's definitely something I would recommend to anyone struggling to stay focused, whether it's for studying or even working on other projects.

>
> I: bring me a sense of calm and relaxation. There's something almost meditative about running my fingers along the strings and producing those flowing, melodic sounds.
>
> 特点：
>
> 1. The instrument has a very distinct timbre, often described as both delicate and powerful. It can mimic the sound of flowing water, which is why it's commonly used in traditional Chinese music to evoke the beauty of nature.
>
> 2. deeply intertwined with Chinese culture and history, played during festivals, convey a wide range of emotions
>
> (For me, mastering the Gu Zheng has been both a challenging and rewarding journey. It requires a lot of precision and control, especially when it comes to finger movements and using techniques like vibrato and glissando to express different moods. However, the effort is definitely worth it because, beyond the technical skills, it has helped me connect with my cultural heritage and develop a deeper appreciation for traditional Chinese music.)

#### （7）有趣的歌曲

Describe an interesting song

You should say

What the song is

What story the song tells

Whether the song is popular

And explain why you think it is interesting

>  One song that I find particularly interesting is **PPAP**, which stands for *Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen*. It was released by a Japanese artist named **Pikotaro** in 2016 and became an unexpected viral sensation. The song itself is quite simple, both in terms of its lyrics and its melody, but it's the quirky and absurd nature of it that makes it so interesting.
>
> The song's lyrics are ridiculously catchy and repetitive, consisting mostly of the words "Pen," "Pineapple," "Apple," and "Pen" being paired together in a way that doesn't make any logical sense. For example, Pikotaro sings "I have a pen, I have an apple, uh! Apple pen!" It sounds almost childish, but that's what makes it so entertaining. The repetitive nature of the song, combined with its simple but energetic beat, creates a sense of fun and lightheartedness that's hard not to smile at when you hear it.
>
> What really grabbed people's attention, though, was the **dance** that goes along with the song. It's very simple, just a few hand gestures mimicking the action of holding a pen and an apple, but it became so iconic that people from all over the world started making their own versions of the dance, adding to its viral appeal. I think that's why it became such a huge hit globally, even though it's not a serious or traditional song. It has this kind of **silly charm** that makes it hard to forget.
>
> Despite the song's simplicity, I find it interesting because of how **infectious** it is. You can hear it just once, and it'll stay stuck in your head for hours, which is a sign of a very successful and memorable song. Even though it's not a song with deep lyrics or complex composition, its charm comes from how it plays with absurdity and humor, and how it reflects the way people in today's world are drawn to quirky, offbeat content.
>
> What I also find fascinating about **PPAP** is how it became a **cultural phenomenon**. The song was widely shared on social media and even appeared on various TV shows and in memes. It became a symbol of internet culture, and even though Pikotaro is a relatively unknown artist, he gained worldwide recognition because of it. So, for me, **PPAP** is a great example of how the Internet and social media can turn something unexpected into a global trend.
>
> In conclusion, I find **PPAP** interesting not just because of the catchy tune and the silly dance, but because it represents a unique moment in pop culture where something simple, quirky, and unexpected can capture the attention of millions and go viral. It's a fun song that always makes me smile whenever I hear it.

>  One event that I organized successfully was an **icebreaker activity** for a student society that I'm part of. This took place last semester when our society was welcoming new members, and we wanted to create a warm and friendly atmosphere where everyone could get to know each other better.
>
> The idea of organizing this event came to me because I noticed that new members often felt a bit **shy and hesitant** to interact with others during our meetings. Since I was in charge of member engagement, I decided to hold an icebreaker activity to help everyone feel more comfortable and connected.
>
> To organize the event, I first spent some time **researching fun and engaging icebreaker games** that would be suitable for a group of around 30 people. I eventually settled on a mix of activities, such as "Two Truths and a Lie" and a team-based scavenger hunt. These games were interactive, easy to participate in, and didn't require any special equipment, which made it practical given our limited resources.
>
> Next, I planned out the logistics. I reserved a spacious room on campus, made sure we had all the necessary materials like notepads and small prizes for the winners and even arranged for some **snacks and refreshments**. I also created a schedule to ensure that everything ran smoothly, starting with a quick introduction, followed by the games, and ending with some free time for everyone to chat.
>
> On the day of the event, I was a bit nervous about whether everything would go as planned. However, to my relief, the activities turned out to be a **huge success**. The new members were **initially a bit reserved**, but once the games began, everyone started laughing, interacting, and forming new friendships. The "Two Truths and a Lie" game was particularly effective because it encouraged people to share interesting facts about themselves, which led to some lively discussions.
>
> The feedback I received afterward was overwhelmingly positive. Many members told me that the icebreaker activities helped them feel **more at ease** and excited to participate in future societal events. This made me feel incredibly proud because I had achieved my goal of fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment.
>
> **In hindsight**（事后回想）, organizing this event taught me a lot about **planning and time management**. It also boosted my confidence in my organizational skills, and I felt a great sense of accomplishment knowing that I had brought people together and helped create a sense of community. It's definitely an experience I would love to repeat, and I'm already thinking of ways to make the next event even more engaging.

And how you felt about it

>  An ambition that I haven't yet achieved is **securing an internship** during my last summer holiday. I had been really eager to gain some practical work experience before graduating, so I set a goal for myself to find an internship in my field of study. However, despite my best efforts, things didn't quite go as planned.
>
> To prepare for this, I spent a significant amount of time **polishing my CV** and writing tailored cover letters. I wanted to make sure that my application stood out, so I highlighted my academic achievements, extracurricular activities, and any relevant skills I had acquired. Once I felt confident with my resume, I started sending it out to various companies, hoping to land a position that would align with my career goals.
>
> Unfortunately, despite applying to numerous companies and positions, I faced a lot of **rejections**. Some companies didn't respond at all, while others sent polite but **discouraging emails**. It was quite disappointing, especially since I had invested so much time and effort into the application process. I even reached out to a few contacts and alumni for advice, but it still didn't work out.
>
> One of the challenges I encountered was the fact that many companies preferred candidates with **prior experience**, which created a sort of paradox: I needed experience to get the internship, but I needed the internship to gain experience. This was definitely frustrating and made me question my own abilities at times.
>
> Despite not achieving this goal, I've tried to look at the situation positively. I realized that setbacks like these are part of the journey and can be **valuable learning experiences**. I've learned to handle rejection better and have a clearer understanding of how competitive the job market can be. This experience has motivated me to **enhance my skills** even further, whether it's by taking online courses or participating in workshops, so that I can be better prepared for future opportunities.
>
> I'm still determined to find an internship or some practical experience in my field before I graduate. I plan to **start my search earlier** next time, expand my network, and perhaps explore opportunities in smaller companies or startups where the competition might not be as fierce. I believe that if I stay persistent and continue to improve my skill set, I will eventually achieve this ambition.

>  So, my little cousin was only 8 or 9 years old at that time, and he just got a new puzzle for his birthday. It was a big one, probably 200 pieces. So, obviously, it was a bit of a challenge for him.
> My uncle and his wife were cooking in the kitchen, and they left me and my cousin in the living room. In the beginning, the little boy was trying to show off（显摆） by putting the puzzle together all by himself. But very soon, he realized that it was a “mission impossible”（不可能的任务）. So, he turned to（求助于我） me. I saw those puppy eyes（狗狗眼，可怜巴巴的），I couldn't say NO, and I decided to give him a hand（帮一把） and teach him the logic behind ==assembling a puzzle==.
> In terms of how I helped him, basically, I helped him by teaching him the logic of doing a puzzle. I told him to always start from finding the corner pieces（四角的块块） and the edge pieces（四条边线上的块块）. That would set the stage（铺垫前景） and make things much easier（让事情变得简单）. 
> So, together, we picked out the four corner pieces first, and, bit by bit, we hunted down（找到） all the edge pieces, lining them up（连成一条直线） to frame the whole picture. My cousin got the hang of it（找到感觉，上手）pretty quick, his little hands moving faster with each piece he placed. I was just there to tell him in the right direction from time to time. Then, piece by piece, the image started to come alive（呈现出来）, and you could tell he was really proud of what he was achieving. By the time we put in the last piece, the whole picture looked awesome. It put a big smile on his smile（让他很开心）.
> He couldn't thank me enough（非常感谢）. I felt quite happy that I helped him and taught him some new skills. I enjoyed the feeling of “imparting knowledge”（传输知识） and also being the super hero for my little cousin.

His voice immediately caught my attention – it has this **ethereal**（超凡的）, almost **otherworldly** quality. Since then, I’ve followed his updates on platforms like Weibo and NetEase Music.
>
>  What really attracts me to follow Zhou Shen on social media is **his authenticity and his connection with fans**. Despite his fame, he’s always been very humble and down-to-earth. His posts often feature behind-the-scenes glimpses of his life, from rehearsals to casual moments in his life. He shares his thoughts on music and life, and this personal touch makes him more relatable.

And explain how you feel about the way/change

> One change that has significantly helped me save time and increase my productivity is using the Pomodoro Technique. This is a time-management method that involves working in focused bursts of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four ‘Pomodoros' , you take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. I first came across the Pomodoro Technique during university when I was struggling to balance studying with other commitments.
>
> Before I started using it, I would often **find myself procrastinating or working inefficiently** for long hours without getting much done. The Pomodoro Technique has completely transformed the way I approach tasks. It breaks down the work into manageable chunks, so I never feel overwhelmed, and the short breaks allow me to recharge before diving back into the task.
>
> One of the major advantages is that it helps me stay **highly focused**. Knowing that I only need to work for a short, set period means that I'm less likely to get distracted or lose motivation. I find that I'm able to maintain a higher level of concentration compared to when I try to work for several hours straight. Over time, I've found that I'm able to complete tasks much faster, without compromising the quality of my work.
>
> In addition, the Pomodoro Technique also encourages me to be more mindful about how I use my time. Because I have these short breaks, I've become more conscious of my productivity patterns and can adjust my workflow if I feel I'm not being as efficient as I could be. Overall, adopting the Pomodoro Technique has saved me a lot of time by helping me **work more effectively, stay organized, and reduce burnout**.

These activities brought everyone together, and it was a great way to bond with classmates and even make new friends. I especially enjoyed the friendly, competitive spirit that filled the air.

> However, the **highlight** of the day was definitely the **party performances** held on the playground in the evening. As night fell, the entire campus was lit up with fairy lights and decorations, creating a magical ambiance. There were performances by student bands, dance groups, and even some comedy sketches, which had everyone laughing and clapping. Additionally, there was a campfire activity where all the students gathered around the flames, dancing and enjoying each other's company under the night sky.
>
> What made this event so special was not just the celebration itself but also the feeling of **togetherness**. It was the perfect way to wrap up the year and welcome a new one surrounded by friends, laughter, and a sense of community. I felt genuinely happy and grateful to be a part of such a lively and positive environment.

#### （14）有用的发明

Describe an invention which is very useful in your daily life

You should say:

What it is

What do you use it for

Is it easy to use

And explain why it is useful

>  Today, I'd like to talk about an invention that has become incredibly useful in my life: **online payment systems**. This technology has really transformed how I ==handle my finances and go about my daily activities==. It includes various platforms like mobile banking apps, digital wallets, and payment systems like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and others.
> I first started using online payments a few years ago, and it's made my life so much easier and more efficient. In the past, whenever I needed to pay bills or make purchases, I had to visit physical stores or banks, which was ==time-consuming==, especially with long queues. Now, I can pay for almost anything with just a few taps on my phone. Whether it's paying for groceries, ordering food delivery, or booking a taxi, I can do it instantly without needing cash or even a physical card. Also, these systems are ==highly secure, with encryption and two-factor authentication==, so I don't worry much about fraud.
> Another thing I appreciate about online payments is how they make traveling simpler. I don't have to carry large amounts of cash when I'm in a foreign country. I can just use my phone to pay for things, which is really helpful and ==reduces the hassle of currency exchange==.
> Overall, I would say online payments have made my life more convenient, efficient, and secure. It's hard to imagine going back to the old days when I had to withdraw cash from ATMs or write checks. This invention has definitely become an indispensable part of my everyday life, and I believe it's something that more people will continue to rely on in the future.

**1. What qualities do inventors have?**
Inventors typically possess qualities like creativity, curiosity, and perseverance. They are able to ==think outside the box== and come up with innovative solutions to problems. Curiosity drives them to explore new ideas and ask questions that others might overlook. Additionally, perseverance is crucial because the invention process often involves trial and error, failures, and setbacks. Inventors also need strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently or collaboratively, depending on the project.

**2. Do all inventions bring benefits to our world?**
Not all inventions bring benefits; some can have negative consequences or unintended side effects. For example, while inventions like ==plastic== have revolutionized industries, they have also led to environmental pollution. Similarly, advancements in technology, such as social media, have connected people globally but have also contributed to issues like misinformation and mental health problems. It’s important to evaluate the long-term impact of inventions to ensure they contribute positively to society.

**3. Who should support and sponsor inventors, governments or private companies?**
Both governments and private companies have roles to play in supporting inventors. Governments can provide ==funding, grants, and policies== that encourage innovation, especially in areas that may ==not be immediately profitable but are socially beneficial==, such as healthcare or environmental sustainability. Private companies, on the other hand, can offer ==resources, expertise, and market access== to bring inventions to life. A collaborative approach, where both sectors work together, can create an environment that fosters innovation and ensures its benefits are widely shared.

**4. What inventions do you think should be improved?**
An area for improvement is plastic materials. While plastic is versatile and durable, its non-biodegradable nature has led to environmental crises. Developing eco-friendly alternatives or better recycling methods is essential.

**5. Do you think only scientists can invent new things?**
No, I don’t think only scientists can invent new things. While scientists often play a key role in technological and medical advancements, ==inventors come from all walks of life==. For example, entrepreneurs, engineers, artists, and even everyday individuals can come up with innovative ideas or solutions to problems. Many inventions arise from practical needs or creative thinking rather than formal scientific research. Collaboration across different fields and perspectives often leads to the most groundbreaking innovations.

**6. Are there any other inventions that make the world better?**
Yes, there are countless inventions that have made the world better. For instance, the internet has revolutionized communication, education, and access to information, connecting people across the globe. Medical inventions like vaccines and antibiotics have saved millions of lives and improved public health. Renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, are helping to combat climate change by providing cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. These inventions demonstrate how creativity and innovation can address global challenges and improve quality of life.

#### （15）一次非常忙碌的经历

Describe a time you were very busy

You should say:

When it happened

Where you were

What you did

And explain why you were busy

>  I'd like to talk about a time when I was extremely busy, which happened during the exams week in college last semester. It was one of the most **stressful periods** I've ever experienced because I had to prepare for nine exams, and I only had a week to do it. To be honest, I got myself into that situation because I had ==procrastinated on my review schedule== and left everything until the last minute.
>
>  At the start of that week, I realized how much I needed to catch up on. Each subject required intensive preparation, and the topics were quite challenging. I was ==overwhelmed==, but there was no time to waste, so I quickly created a strict study plan. I divided my time into blocks, dedicating several hours each day to each subject, and even sacrificed sleep to make more time for studying. There were days when I was up until 3 or 4 in the morning, only to wake up a few hours later and continue revising.
>
>  To make things even more stressful, all the exams were **back-to-back with no breaks in between**. I remember one particular day when I had two exams, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. As soon as I finished the first exam, I rushed to the library to cram for the next one. I had to juggle multiple textbooks, class notes, and online resources, trying to digest as much information as possible in a short time.
>
>  What made it even more difficult was that **each subject required a different approach**. For subjects like mathematics and physics, I had to focus on solving practice problems, while for literature and politics, I had to memorize facts and analyze texts. I was mentally exhausted, but I kept ==pushing through== because I knew I didn't have any other option.
>
>  In the end, it was an exhausting week, but it paid off. I managed to ==get through== all nine exams, and although I didn't get perfect scores, I was able to pass them all with decent grades. The experience taught me a valuable lesson about **time management** and the importance of starting my preparation early. I realized that the stress and sleepless nights could have been avoided if I had been more disciplined with my study schedule from the beginning.
>
>  Looking back, it was definitely one of the busiest and most intense weeks of my college life. But it also showed me that when pushed to the limit, I'm capable of focusing and working hard under pressure. Now, I always try to plan ahead to avoid getting into such stressful situations again.

Being too busy can lead to stress, burnout, and a lack of work-life balance. It may also leave little time for relaxation, self-care, or spending time with loved ones. Therefore, it’s important to find a balance between staying busy and allowing time for rest.

**2. Do you think children should learn through playing games or under pressure?**
I believe children learn best through playing games rather than under pressure. Games make learning fun and engaging, which helps children retain information and develop skills like problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork. For example, educational games can teach math, language, or science concepts in an interactive way. On the other hand, learning under pressure can lead to anxiety, fear of failure, and a negative attitude toward education. A balanced approach, where play is combined with gentle guidance, is ideal for fostering a love of learning.

**3. What kind of pressure do people may experience at work?**
People may experience various types of pressure at work, such as meeting tight deadlines, handling heavy workloads, or dealing with high expectations from supervisors. They might also face pressure to perform well, compete with colleagues, or adapt to changes in the workplace. Additionally, interpersonal conflicts or a lack of work-life balance can contribute to stress. These pressures can affect mental and physical health, making it important for employers to create a supportive and manageable work environment.

**4. How does technology help with time management?**
Technology helps with time management by providing tools and apps that organize tasks, set reminders, and track progress. For example, calendar apps allow users to schedule appointments and prioritize activities, while project management software helps teams collaborate and meet deadlines efficiently. Additionally, automation tools can handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for more important activities. Technology also enables remote work, reducing time spent commuting and allowing for more flexible schedules. Overall, it enhances productivity and helps people make the most of their time.

**5. Does technology distract people?**
Yes, technology can be a significant source of distraction. For instance, social media, entertainment apps, and notifications often interrupt focus and reduce productivity. Many people find it challenging to resist the temptation to check their phones or browse the internet, especially when working or studying. However, technology can also be used to minimize distractions through features like “do not disturb” modes or apps that block access to distracting sites. The key is to use technology mindfully and set boundaries to stay focused.

Apparently, he had **coordinated with** a local bakery near my school. The cake had a small note attached, expressing how much he missed me and wished he could be there to celebrate with me in person.

> Receiving that cake was incredibly heartwarming and truly made my day. At that moment, I felt a surge of **happiness and appreciation** because I realized just how much he cared. It **wasn't** just the cake itself **but** the thoughtfulness behind the gesture that made it so memorable. To be honest, I was almost moved to tears because it was the last thing I was expecting.

Whenever I need someone to talk to, whether it's about something serious or just a lighthearted chat, Anna is always my go-to person.
> One of the main reasons I enjoy talking to her is because she's such an attentive listener. No matter what I'm talking about, she always gives me her full attention, which is quite rare these days when people are often distracted by their phones. She doesn't just listen passively either—she asks thoughtful questions and offers insightful advice. For example, there was a time when I was really struggling with making an academic decision, and she helped me weigh the pros and cons without being pushy or judgmental. Her ability to understand my perspective and give me advice that's actually helpful is something I truly appreciate.
> Another reason I love our conversations is because we share similar interests, especially when it comes to books, movies, and current events. We often end up having deep discussions about the latest book we've read or a thought-provoking documentary we've watched. These conversations can sometimes last for hours, but it never feels like a waste of time because I always come away feeling inspired or having learned something new.
> What I admire most about Anna is her sense of humor. Even when we're talking about serious topics, she has this amazing ability to make me laugh. It's not that she makes light of serious matters, but rather, she knows how to add a touch of humor that lightens the mood. This is especially comforting when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed—she just has a way of turning my day around with her jokes and witty comments.
> All in all, talking to Anna is something I genuinely look forward to because it's not only enjoyable but also meaningful. I always feel understood, supported, and uplifted after our conversations. It's a rare thing to have someone in your life with whom you can talk about almost anything, and I consider myself lucky to have a friend like her.

>  I'd like to talk about a special day I had recently that cost me almost nothing, but it was truly memorable. This happened a few months ago when my friends and I decided to have a picnic at a nearby park. We were all feeling a bit overwhelmed with our studies and assignments, so we thought it would be a great idea to take a break and relax outdoors. Since we were all on a tight budget, we wanted to do something fun without spending much money.
>
> We planned it quite simply. Each of us brought some **homemade food**, like sandwiches, fruit, and snacks. I took a batch of cookies from ingredients I already had at home, so it didn't cost me anything extra. One of my friends brought a bottle of homemade iced tea, while another brought some fruits that were already in season. It was **a perfect potluck-style picnic** where everyone contributed something small.
>
> On the day of the picnic, we headed to a large park near our university. The weather was perfect—it was sunny but not too hot, with a gentle breeze that made it really pleasant to sit outside. We found a nice shady spot under a big tree where we could spread out our blankets. We spent hours just chatting, laughing, and enjoying each other's company. It felt so refreshing to be away from the usual hustle and bustle of daily life.
>
> What made the day even more special was that we brought along some **game** s. One of my friends brought a deck of cards, and we ended up playing card games. It was so much fun, and we were all laughing so hard that we completely lost track of time. At one point, we even took a short walk around the park, enjoying the beautiful scenery and the blooming flowers.
>
> The best part about that day was that it didn't cost us much at all. Apart from the small cost of the ingredients we used to make the food, everything else was completely free. It made me realize that sometimes, you don't need to spend a lot of money to have a great time. *What truly matters is the people you're with and the quality of the time you spend together*.
>
> Looking back, it was one of the most enjoyable and relaxing days I've had in a long time. It reminded me that sometimes, the simplest things in life can bring the most joy. I think that's a lesson I've carried with me ever since—that you can create beautiful memories without needing to splurge.

Of course, there could be challenges, such as mixing family and business, but I think our strong communication skills would help us overcome any potential conflicts.
> If the opportunity arises in the future, I would love to ==start a creative venture with my cousin==. It excites me, and I believe it would not only strengthen our relationship but also help both of us grow professionally.

>  The longest walk I've ever had was during my senior high school **military training**, which was **an intense and memorable experience**. It was part of a mandatory program designed to build endurance, discipline, and teamwork among students. The walk was about 10 kilometers, and we had to **march** from our school to an outdoor tourist attraction called the **Oriental Oasis**, which is a well-known park and scenic area.
>
> The walk itself was part of a larger training activity, so we had to follow a strict schedule and walk in formation with a large group of fellow students. I remember the morning we set off – it was very early, and the air was cool and fresh. At first, it seemed manageable. But later, as we walked further from the school and into the countryside, the distance started to feel longer and the landscape began to change.
>
> The route wasn't particularly difficult, but **the challenge was maintaining a steady pace**. Such a long walk was very demanding physically, and after a while, my legs started to feel sore. However, there was a sense of camaraderie among my classmates, and we encouraged each other to keep going. We would sing songs or share jokes from time to time to distract ourselves from the exhaustion, and that definitely helped keep our spirits up.
>
> When we finally reached the **Oriental Oasis**, it felt like a huge accomplishment. No one straggled. The sense of relief was overwhelming, and we were able to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. 
>
> In retrospect, that 10-kilometer walk was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life. It taught me a lot about physical endurance, teamwork, and the importance of perseverance. Even though it was tough at times, I'm glad I had the chance to do it, as it not only built my stamina but also gave me a sense of achievement that I still carry with me today.

I started doing this a few years ago, as I felt that my reading and writing skills were improving, but my listening and speaking abilities were still not at the level I wanted.
>
> At first, I watched with subtitles in Chinese to understand the context and storyline, but gradually, I switched to English subtitles. This helped me connect the spoken words with their written form, and it also allowed me to learn new vocabulary and expressions. The great thing about watching movies and TV shows is that they expose you to various accents and colloquial language, which is often not covered in traditional language lessons.
>
> I chose to watch **a variety of genres**, from dramas to comedies, and even documentaries. I wanted to get used to different tones, speeds of speaking, and formal versus informal language. For example, I watched 2 Broke Girls. They use everyday, conversational English, which helped me sound more natural in casual conversations. Additionally, watching documentaries or news programs helped me improve my formal language and understanding of more complex vocabulary.
>
> Another benefit of this approach was that it made learning English more **enjoyable**. Instead of seeing it as a task, I started to look forward to the next episode or movie, and without realizing it, I was learning new phrases and improving my listening skills. It also gave me **a better understanding of culture** and the way people interact in different contexts, which I think is crucial for mastering any language.
>
> Overall, watching TV shows and movies in English was a fun and effective way for me to enhance my language skills. It allowed me to practice listening, pick up new words, and become more familiar with English-speaking cultures, all while keeping my learning process engaging.

>  One item of clothing that I received as a gift and have cherished for years is a handmade sweater from my grandma. She gave it to me as a birthday present several years ago, and it holds a lot of sentimental value for me.
>
> The sweater is really special not just because it's a gift from my grandma, but also because she made it herself. My grandma **has been knitting for** as long as I can remember, and she's always crafted beautiful, intricate pieces for her family. When I opened the package and saw the sweater, I was immediately **struck by the craftsmanship**. It's made of soft wool, and the pattern is quite unique – a combination of subtle colors and geometric shapes that give it a cozy yet stylish look. The fit was perfect at the time, and it was incredibly comfortable to wear.
>
> What makes this sweater even more meaningful is the thought and time my grandma put into making it. She spent weeks working on it, knitting each section carefully, and I know that she poured a lot of love and attention into every stitch. Every time I wore it, I felt a deep connection to her and a sense of warmth, both physically and emotionally.
>
> However, now that I've grown up, I've outgrown the sweater. It no longer fits me as it once did, which is a bit bittersweet. Still, I can't bring myself to part with it because it holds so many memories. Even though I can't wear it anymore, I keep it tucked away in my wardrobe as a reminder of my grandma's affection and the special bond we share. Sometimes, when I'm feeling nostalgic, I take it out just to feel close to her.
>
> Overall, this handmade sweater is one of the most meaningful gifts I've ever received. It's not just about the sweater itself, but the love, effort, and thought behind it. That's why it will always hold a special place in my heart, even if I can no longer wear it.

It's become a local sensation（当地的潮流） for not just dog owners（狗主人）, but also dog lovers（爱狗人士）. I walk my dog（遛狗） in that park when I am at home as it's just a stone's throw away（很近） from where I live. 
>
> Moving on to how I feel about it, well, first off, I feel happy for all the dog owners（狗主人） like me. I can't tell you how much this dog park has changed my life. There're so many things we can do in this park. We can walk our dogs on the winding walking trails（蜿蜒的步行小路）. Or we can just let them run around in the open areas（开场地带）. And there are benches and picnic spots（长椅长凳和野餐地点） for the owners, so it's not just fun for the dogs. It's a nice hangout spot（聚点） for us too.
>
> And then, I love the impacts of this new park. It brings dog owners together（把人带到一起）, creating a sense of community. It's like a social hub where people meet, chat, and share their dog-raising experiences（分享养狗经验）. It's also beneficial for people who don't like dogs or even are afraid of dogs, because this dog park **keeps dogs off the streets**（让狗狗远离大街）, giving those dogs, especially bigger ones, a specific place to be.
> So, yeah, that's the park. Thank you for your time.

> We had been together for about three years, and during that period of time, I was in two minds（犹豫，纠结） all the time. *On one hand*, he was funny and charming. He could really make me laugh. I loved his sense of humor （我喜欢他的幽默感） and his charisma. *On the other hand*, he was a control freak. He always wanted me to listen to him, and say yes to him. He really put a lot of pressure on me. I mean, I'm an independent person with an independent mind, so I couldn't just blindly follow his commands（跟随他的指令）. He was very bossy（霸道的） and macho（大男子主义的）.
> I **was torn between**（很纠结） leaving and staying. I didn't want to rush into the decision（匆忙做决定）, so I waited long enough because I wanted to give it a chance. After being together for three years, I was very unhappy, so I finally made up my mind（彻底下决定） to leave him. I told him about my decision. It wasn't easy for me. I was crying and having a meltdown when I saw him for the last time. And he refused to take it. We were not **on the same page** at all（意见不一致，他不想分手）.
> After the breakup, in the beginning, he was still trying to influence my decision by constantly calling me and trying to see me. It was extremely difficult for me to not pick up the phone. But I pulled myself together（振作起来）. I didn't give him any chances to talk to me. And eventually, after 6 months, he gave up.
> I'm now feeling so much better without him. Everything is water under the bridge（事情都过去了）. Even though I still miss him sometimes, I know it will all be over one day. Time will heal everything（时间会治愈一切）. It was a tough decision to make, but it was the right thing to do.

It happened last year when she was really struggling in her relationship and was torn about whether to break up with her boyfriend or not. She asked me for my honest opinion, and after hearing her out, I suggested that she end the relationship.
>
> My friend had been with her boyfriend for nearly three years, but during that time, she often felt conflicted. On one hand, she told me he was funny, charming, and could always make her laugh. She appreciated his sense of humor and charisma, which had initially drawn her to him. But on the other hand, she described him as controlling and overly domineering. He constantly wanted things to go his way and pressured her to always agree with him. It was clear that he was quite bossy and had a very macho attitude.
>
> As my friend shared all this with me, she was obviously distressed. She explained that she felt suffocated in the relationship because he expected her to follow his commands, which didn't align with her independent nature. I could see how this was affecting her mental and emotional well-being. She was hesitant about making a decision because they had been together for so long, and she felt that ending things might be too drastic. But at the same time, she was unhappy and didn't feel like she could truly be herself around him.
>
> After listening to her, I told her that if the relationship was making her miserable, it was probably better for her to walk away. I reminded her that staying in a relationship out of fear of being alone is never a good reason. She needed to prioritize her own happiness and mental health. Although it was a tough suggestion to make, I believed it was the right call.
>
> In the end, she decided to take my advice and broke up with him. The breakup was really hard on her at first because her ex-boyfriend kept trying to reach out, calling her and asking to meet. I remember she had a hard time resisting the urge to answer his calls, but she stayed strong and eventually cut off all communication. After several months, he finally stopped contacting her, and she began to heal.
>
> Now, she often tells me how grateful she is for my advice. She feels much lighter and happier without the constant stress he brought into her life. While it wasn't easy for her to go through, she now realizes it was the right thing to do. Seeing her in a much better place now confirms that sometimes, giving difficult advice is necessary, even if it's hard for someone to hear.

Describe a time when you were stuck in a traffic jam

You should say:

When it happened

Where you were stuck

What you did while waiting

And explain how you felt in the traffic jam

>  I'd like to talk about a time when I was stuck in a traffic jam, but it wasn't the typical car traffic you might imagine. This happened on my university campus, and it involved bikes rather than cars. Since I'm a student, I commute to different classes on my electric bike every day because our campus is quite large. There's a long break between classes, and during this time, many students, including myself, need to move between buildings. Unfortunately, this often leads to a chaotic situation.
>
> The main issue is that there's only one main road connecting the east and west sides of the campus, and it's the shortest route. Taking any other path would be three times longer, so naturally, everyone prefers using this route. One day, I had a class in a building on the west side, and I had just finished a class in the east. The teacher delayed the class for 5 minutes, so as soon as the class was over, I jumped on my bike and headed towards the other building.
>
> However, as soon as I reached the main road, I found myself stuck in a bike traffic jam. There were dozens, if not hundreds, of students on electric bikes, all trying to use the same road at the same time. The university guard was trying to manage the flow, but many students were impatient and didn't listen to his instructions. This only made the situation worse, as everyone was trying to squeeze through, making the road even more congested.
>
> I was frustrated because I knew I was running late. At one point, we were all **at a standstill**, unable to move forward or backward. When the traffic finally started moving again, I still had to struggle to find a parking spot near my class building. Most of the parking spaces were already full, so I ended up circling around, wasting even more time. In the end, I arrived five minutes late for my class, which was quite embarrassing.
>
> Looking back, it was a stressful experience, but it also taught me to plan my commute better during those peak times. Now, if I know I have back-to-back classes in different buildings, I try to leave a bit earlier to avoid getting stuck in that bike traffic jam. It's definitely one of those unique challenges of being a student on a large campus.

And explain why you would like to participate in it

>  One competition I would really like to participate in is the **bicycle slow-riding contest** held at my school. This competition is quite unique because it challenges participants to ride their bicycles as slowly as possible without losing balance or touching the ground. I first got interested in this competition when my roommate participated in it last year and ended up winning first place. I was really impressed by how skillfully she managed to maintain her balance while riding at such a slow pace, and it inspired me to give it a try myself.
>
> What makes this competition so **intriguing** to me is that it's not about speed or endurance, but rather about balance, control, and patience. The riders are required to pedal slowly and steadily, and if you stop or put your feet on the ground, you're **disqualified**. It's a real test of your ability to stay focused and maintain steady control of the bike, which I think is a fun and challenging way to compete.
>
> I believe I would be able to do well in this competition because I have a good sense of balance. I've been riding bicycles since I was quite young, and over the years, I've developed a pretty solid skill set for balancing and controlling my bike in different situations.
>
> One of the things I like most about this competition is that it's accessible to everyone on campus. I'm excited about the idea of participating because it would be a great way to test my limits, improve my concentration, and also have a bit of fun with my friends. I'd definitely be proud to take part in such a competition and maybe even bring home a trophy like my roommate did.

> One of the most surprising and happiest moments I've experienced was when I received a **birthday cake from my boyfriend** at the time. This happened about two years ago, and I still remember it vividly because it was such an unexpected yet touching gesture.
>
> To give you some context, my boyfriend and I were in a **long-distance relationship** back then. My birthday was approaching, and honestly, I wasn't expecting much since we couldn't be together in person. I had planned to just spend the day quietly with a few close friends. However, on the morning of my birthday, I received a delivery, and to my absolute surprise, there was a **beautifully decorated cake** waiting for me.
>
> What made this surprise so special was the effort he put into it. It wasn't just any store-bought cake—it was **handcrafted and customized** with my favorite flavors and decorations. Apparently, he had **coordinated with** a local bakery near my school. The cake had a small note attached, expressing how much he missed me and wished he could be there to celebrate with me in person.
>
> Receiving that cake was incredibly heartwarming and truly made my day. At that moment, I felt a surge of **happiness and appreciation** because I realized just how much he cared. It **wasn't** just the cake itself **but** the thoughtfulness behind the gesture that made it so memorable. To be honest, I was almost moved to tears because it was the last thing I was expecting.
>
> Sadly, we eventually **broke up** due to the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship. However, looking back, that surprise is still one of the **fondest memories** I have. It not only made me happy but also reminded me that even small gestures can have a significant impact on someone's emotions.

>  I'd like to talk about a time when I received some very helpful advice regarding my studies during high school. Back then, I was under a lot of pressure to perform well academically, and I often found myself feeling overwhelmed and distracted whenever I tried to study. So, I decided to visit the school's counseling office to seek some guidance.
>
> When I explained my situation to the counselor, I told her that my biggest struggle was maintaining concentration. I would often start studying with good intentions, but within minutes, my mind would wander off, and I'd end up procrastinating or getting distracted by my phone. That's when she suggested a technique called the Pomodoro Technique, which was something I had never heard of before.
>
> The Pomodoro Technique involves breaking your study time into 25-minute intervals, called "pomodoros," followed by a short 5-minute break. After completing four of these intervals, you can take a longer break of about 15 to 30 minutes. The counselor explained that this method helps improve focus and productivity by giving the brain regular breaks, which prevents burnout and keeps you refreshed. She advised me to try it out, especially since I was struggling with staying on task for long periods.
>
> I decided to follow her advice, and to my surprise, it made a significant difference. I started using a timer on my phone to break my study sessions into 25-minute chunks, and I noticed that my concentration improved dramatically. Knowing that a break was coming made it easier to stay focused during each interval. I also felt less stressed because instead of trying to force myself to study for hours on end, I was working in manageable bursts. It made my study sessions much more efficient and even enjoyable.
>
> What I appreciated most about this advice was that it was **practical and easy to implement**, yet it had a profound impact on my productivity. This simple technique helped me manage my study stress better and made a noticeable difference in my performance. To this day, I still use the Pomodoro Technique whenever I need to focus on a challenging task, and I'm grateful to that counselor for introducing me to it.
>
> Overall, this experience taught me that sometimes, the right advice can completely change the way you approach your studies. The Pomodoro Technique was a game-changer for me, and it's something that continues to benefit me even now.

> Normally I'm not a **scatterbrain**（马虎健忘之人）. I don't lose things easily. I'm always double checking（反复确认） my stuff before I leave a place, super mindful. That's why I remember this experience so well, that was one of the only few times that I lost my stuff.
>
> It was my dear iPad. Last year, I took the train back home. And in order to kill the time on my way, I took out my iPad. In the beginning, I was watching a movie. And then, I started feeling very sleepy and wanted to take a nap（打个盹）.
>
> I felt lazy（犯懒） to put the iPad back into my suitcase, as I knew later, I would use it again after the nap. So, I put the iPad in the pocket in front of me. You know, there's always a thin pocket behind the seat in front of you（你前面座位的后方的薄薄的口袋）? So, yeh, I put it there. The pocket was not big, so I could still see the tip of my ipad（平板电脑的上方一角）. I thought that would remind me that there was my tablet in the pocket. But NO! I completely forgot my iPad after the nap. Like it was never there. I just removed the memory out of my brain（从记忆力删除了这个信息）. 
>
> After I got off the train, several hours passed by, and suddenly **I jumped out of my skin**（跳出我的皮肤，吓得灵魂出窍）. “Where is my iPad?! ”And that was when I remembered it was still on the train!! I called the lost and found office（失物招领办公室） at the train station, told them about my tragedy（悲剧）. The customer service representative（客服代表）comforted me（安抚了我）, and helped me call the head of  the conductor of the train（一个意思，车长）, anyway, he said he would search it for me.
> Several hours later, I got a phone call from him and was told that he found the iPad. I felt so lucky and grateful to get my baby back. And at the same time, I felt very guilty for being so unmindful. I hate troubling people（我讨厌麻烦别人）. So, yeh, that was the story.

You should say:

What it is

Why it is important to keep fit and healthy

And explain why it can help you keep fit and healthy

>  One activity I regularly do to stay fit is **following an online streamer for exercise routines**. I started this habit around a year ago when I realized I needed to improve my fitness level but didn't have the motivation to go to a gym or fitness class. The convenience of exercising at home with the guidance of a live streamer was a game-changer for me.
>
> The streamer I follow specializes in **HIIT workouts**, which stand for **High-Intensity Interval Training**. These sessions typically last about 30 to 45 minutes and combine cardio exercises with strength training, which helps me not only burn calories but also build muscle. What I find particularly motivating is that the streamer often **interacts with viewers**, offering words of encouragement and answering questions in real-time. This interactive aspect makes the experience much more engaging than simply following a pre-recorded video.
>
> One of the main reasons I enjoy exercising this way is that it fits easily into my schedule. I can join the live stream whenever it's convenient for me, and if I miss a session, I can always watch the recording later. Plus, the **variety of workouts** keeps things interesting. The streamer mixes things up by incorporating different types of exercises, like yoga stretches or core workouts, so it never feels monotonous.
>
> I've noticed significant benefits since I started these workouts. I've become more **energetic**, and my **endurance** has improved considerably. Additionally, it's been great for my **mental health**, especially when I've had a long, stressful day. Following along with someone who's both knowledgeable and enthusiastic really helps me stay consistent and motivated.
>
> In the future, I'd like to explore other fitness routines, but for now, **following this online streamer** is definitely my favorite way to stay fit. It's practical, effective, and, most importantly, enjoyable.

>  Ok, so today I'd like to talk about a place in my city where I can see some wildlife. It's a mountainous area on the outskirts of my city called Laohe Shan. I first went there a few years ago when I was feeling pretty stressed with schoolwork and just needed to clear my head（清空大脑）. Since then, it's become my go-to spot（首选地点）whenever I need a break from the hustle and bustle of daily life（需要从日常的喧嚣与繁忙之中抽空休息一下）.
>
> Laohe Shan is not a well-known tourist destination（不是一个知名的旅游地点）. It's peaceful, with only a few tourists or locals during the week. The reason I love going to this place is **the sense of tranquility**（宁静之感） it gives me. It's the perfect spot for unwinding and recharging（放松与充电）. 
>
> In terms of wildlife, there's a lot to see. You can find/ spot（发现） all sorts of birds, from colorful songbirds（鸣禽） to bigger ones like owls and hawks（猫头鹰和山鹰）. One time, I even saw a wild squirrel running across the trail（横穿小路）, which was a nice surprise. There are also tons of insects, especially butterflies in the spring and summer. The area is full of plant life too, with lots of different types of trees and wildflowers（野花）.
>
> 安静的地方替换上面 wildlife 一段：(As I walk along the mountain's shaded paths, I can hear nothing but the rustle of leaves and birds chirping. The air is incredibly fresh, and the scent of pine trees and wildflowers is everywhere. On the top of the mountain, I can overlook a remote lake, surrounded by willow trees reflected in the calm, mirror-like water. It feels like I am stepping back in time to a simpler, more relaxed era.)
>
> The best part for me is just how connected I feel to nature when I'm there. I love sitting under the shade of a tree（坐在树荫下）, watching the birds or even reading a good book. Sometimes, I'll just close my eyes and take in（感受、吸收） the sounds of the forest; it's incredibly calming. I love this place. Thank you!

How it was broken

And how you felt about it

>  I'd like to talk about a time when the **kitchen tap** in our home broke, and I managed to fix it on my own. It wasn't anything too complicated, but it was definitely a challenge at first, especially since I had never attempted any plumbing repairs before.
>
> One day, while I was washing dishes, I noticed that the tap was leaking, and water kept dripping even after turning it off completely. This was not only wasteful but also pretty annoying, so I decided to take matters into my own hands. At first, I thought about asking my parents to call a plumber, but then I figured it would be a good learning experience to try and fix it myself.
>
> The first thing I did was watch a couple of **tutorial videos** online to understand the basics of how a tap works and what might be causing the issue. After some research, I realized that the problem was most likely a **worn-out washer** inside the tap. Luckily, we had a set of basic tools and some spare washers at home.
>
> I turned off the water supply and carefully **unscrewed the tap handle**. I was a bit nervous at first, worried that I might make the problem worse, but I managed to remove the faulty washer and replace it with a new one. Once I put everything back together and turned on the water supply again, I was thrilled to see that the leak had stopped!
>
> Honestly, fixing the tap gave me a real sense of accomplishment. It wasn't just about saving the cost of hiring a professional, but also about gaining the confidence to handle small repairs around the house. Plus, it felt good to be able to contribute to maintaining our home, especially since I'm usually not very handy with tools.
>
> In conclusion, what started as a minor household inconvenience turned into a valuable learning experience. It made me realize that with the right resources and a bit of patience, even a teenager like me can handle simple repairs.

Describe a rule that you dislike and would like to change in the future

You should say:

What it is

What it is for

Why you don't like it

And explain why you would like to change it

>  One rule that I strongly disagree with and would love to change is the annual physical fitness test that all students in Chinese universities are required to take, except for those with physical disabilities. This rule mandates that every student must meet a certain fitness standard in order to graduate, and I find it not only unreasonable but also counterproductive in some ways.
> First of all, the idea of having a unified fitness standard for all students is simply unrealistic. Every individual's health condition and fitness level are different, and this rule fails to take that into account. For example, I myself am not particularly good at physical activities due to issues with my respiratory system. During physical exercises, I often experience significant pain and discomfort, especially when I engage in endurance activities like running. This makes it extremely hard for me to meet the required fitness benchmarks. On the other hand, there are students who are naturally more athletic and enthusiastic about sports, and for them, this test might even feel like a fun challenge. The idea of applying the same standard to everyone is, in my opinion, unscientific and unfair.
> Furthermore, I believe that this physical fitness test erodes students'quality of life and freedom. University life should be about personal growth and exploration, but the pressure to meet an arbitrary fitness standard can lead to unnecessary stress. Instead of encouraging a healthy lifestyle, it often forces students into routines that may not be suitable for their individual needs. For students like me, who may have physical discomfort during strenuous activities, this rule can lead to feelings of inadequacy or even worsen their health problems. In the long run, it may also contribute to the development of negative attitudes towards fitness.
> The rule also seems outdated in today's world, where universities are increasingly focusing on personalized education and promoting mental well-being alongside physical health. Instead of imposing a one-size-fits-all fitness test, I believe universities should take a more individualized approach. For instance, students could be given a choice to take fitness assessments that align with their personal health conditions or interests, such as offering alternative activities like yoga, swimming, or even mental health workshops for those who struggle with physical challenges.
> In conclusion, I strongly feel that the fitness test rule in Chinese universities needs to be reformed or replaced with a more flexible and personalized approach that considers students'  unique needs and capabilities. This would not only improve the students'physical and mental well-being but also allow them to focus more on their academic goals and overall development.

>  Today, I'd like to talk about an **interesting city** worth visiting — **Shanghai**. It is located on the eastern coast of China. Shanghai is not only one of the largest cities in the world but also one of the most vibrant and diverse. It seamlessly blends **traditional Chinese culture** with modern, cutting-edge development, making it a truly fascinating place to explore.
>
> One of the things that immediately struck me about Shanghai is its **iconic skyline**, especially the area known as the **Bund**. On one side, you have historic colonial-era buildings, and on the other, the futuristic skyscrapers of **Pudong**, like the **Oriental Pearl Tower** and the **Shanghai Tower**, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world. At night, the cityscape lights up with colorful displays, creating a breathtaking view.
>
> What I find most interesting about Shanghai is its unique blend of **old and new**. For instance, you can visit the ancient **Yu Garden**, which dates back to the Ming Dynasty, and within minutes, you can find yourself in the bustling, high-tech shopping district of **Nanjing Road**. It's a city where tradition and modernity coexist harmoniously, offering a rich cultural experience.
>
> Another thing I absolutely love about Shanghai is its **diverse food scene**. Whether you're sampling street food like the famous **xiaolongbao**, which are juicy soup dumplings, or dining at upscale restaurants, there's something for every *palate*. The city is also known for its vibrant nightlife, with trendy bars and rooftop lounges that offer stunning views of the cityscape.
>
> Beyond its sights and cuisine, what makes Shanghai truly captivating is its **dynamic energy**. The city never seems to sleep, and there's always something happening, whether it's a cultural festival, an art exhibition, or a live music performance. It's a place that attracts people from all over the world, making it a melting pot of different cultures and ideas.
>
> Personally, I find Shanghai inspiring because it's constantly evolving while still preserving its rich cultural heritage. It's a city that reflects China's rapid modernization but also honors its past. It's a place that leaves a lasting impression and makes you want to return again and again. For anyone looking to experience the best of what a modern metropolis can offer, Shanghai is definitely a must-visit destination.

> Today, I'd like to share a story that my mom told me while I was away at school. It's about our **French Bulldog**, Gama, and his funny encounters with the neighborhood **cats**. It was really funny that I couldn't stop laughing when hearing it!
>
> So, here's what happened. Gama is a curious little guy—full of energy and always eager to explore. One day, my mom took him out for his usual walk around our neighborhood. As they were strolling down a street, they came across a group of **three or four cats** lounging in the sun.
>
> Now, Gama, being his usual friendly self, decided to approach them. He perked up（振奋） his little **stubby tail**, wiggling 扭动 his entire backside in excitement as he tried to greet them. However, the cats, being aloof 冷淡的 as they often are, weren't too impressed with Gama's enthusiasm. According to my mom, one of the cats even **gave a warning hiss**. But instead of getting scared, Gama just tilted his head, almost like he was trying to figure out why they weren't as happy to see him.
>
> My mom was a bit nervous that the situation might **escalate**, but instead of attacking, the cats just stared at Gama, clearly perplexed. Eventually, one of the cats, probably the leader, cautiously approached him, gave him a quick sniff, and then walked off as if to say, "You're not worth my time."
>
> What I found most **hilarious** 极其滑稽的 about this story is that Gama, despite his confident attitude, ended up looking so puzzled when the cats ignored him. My mom described how he kept tilting his head from side to side with his big watery eyes, trying to make sense of what had just happened. It was like he was expecting some sort of grand interaction, but got a cold shoulder.
>
> This story really stuck with me because it perfectly captures Gama's personality—he's always so enthusiastic and eager to make friends, even if the other animals don't quite reciprocate. Hearing my mom describe it so vividly made me feel like I was right there with them, and it reminded me of how much I miss those little moments with Gama when I'm away.

And explain how you feel about him/her

>  I'd like to talk about a girl I met recently at my friend's dinner party. It was a gathering where I got the chance to meet a lot of new people, and this particular girl, who sat next to me, really stood out. We started talking almost immediately, and from the very first conversation, I could tell that we clicked. She was incredibly friendly, outgoing, and easy to talk to, and it felt like we were on the same wavelength. We just “got” each other, and the conversation flowed effortlessly.
>
> What really intrigued me about her was that she was a professional traveler, and at the time, she had already traveled to over 40 different countries. She shared some of the most fascinating travel stories I'd ever heard. I could tell she was a great storyteller because I was completely captivated by everything she said. Her stories weren't just about the places she visited; they were filled with details about the people she met, the cultures she experienced, and the unique moments that made each trip memorable. I was absolutely engaged throughout our conversation, and I couldn't help but feel inspired by her adventures.
>
> I really enjoyed talking to her because, first of all, I'm someone who loves traveling too, so we had that in common. I found her experiences both exciting and educational. She was also incredibly knowledgeable about the world in general, not just travel. It was clear that she had a deep understanding of different cultures, global issues, and various ways of life. This made her very charismatic, as she didn't just talk about herself, but also shared insights and interesting facts about the world.
>
> What I appreciated the most about her, though, was how humble she was. Despite having traveled so much and experienced so many things, she didn't **come across as** pretentious or self-centered at all. It's common to meet people who have had extensive life experiences and for them to be a bit arrogant or always turn the conversation back to themselves. But she was the complete opposite. She was a great listener and was genuinely interested in what I had to say. I felt like she cared about my stories, too, and that made me admire her even more.
>
> Since we only met that once, I've been really curious to get to know her better. I would love to hear more about her travels and learn from her perspectives on life, as she seemed so open-minded and wise. I also think she could teach me a lot about staying humble and grounded, despite achieving so much. So, I definitely hope to see her again and continue our conversation.

#### （41）印象深刻的课程

Describe a course that impressed you a lot

You should say:

What the course was about

Where you took the course

And explain why it impressed you a lot

>  One course that left a lasting impression on me was actually a **physical education class** I took a while ago, rather than a traditional academic lesson. It was a team-building exercise that was both fun and incredibly insightful. The highlight of this class was a game called "**Tongxin Drum**," which translates to "United Drum." This activity was designed to enhance our teamwork and collaboration skills.
>
> The setup was quite **simple yet challenging**. We were divided into groups of eight, with each person positioned at a different point around a large, circular drum. The drum was suspended in the air by eight ropes, each held by one of us. In the middle of the drum, there was a ball, and our task was to move together in perfect coordination to bounce the ball continuously without letting it fall off. The goal was to see how many times we could bounce the ball in a row.
>
> What impressed me the most about this class was how it forced us to **work together seamlessly**. At first, it seemed like a straightforward task, but it turned out to be much more challenging than we expected. Each of us had to maintain just the right amount of tension on our ropes, and even the slightest movement by one person would affect the entire drum. We quickly realized that in order to succeed, we needed to **communicate clearly and synchronize our movements**. It was an excellent way to understand the importance of teamwork because if even one person was out of sync, the ball would fall off almost immediately.
>
> This course not only improved our physical coordination but also taught us valuable lessons about collaboration and trust. I remember feeling a great **sense of accomplishment** when we finally managed to keep the ball bouncing for more than 30 times in a row. It required **patience, quick thinking, and a lot of encouragement** from each other. The experience was both fun and rewarding, and it brought us closer as a group.
>
> What made this class particularly memorable was how it combined physical exercise with practical life skills. It was **a refreshing break from the usual sports activities**, and it showed me that even something as simple as moving in sync with others can teach us a lot about teamwork, trust, and communication. To this day, I remember that lesson whenever I'm working in a group setting because it reminded me how crucial it is to listen, adapt, and support each other.
>
> Overall, the "Tongxin Drum" game during that PE class was a unique and impactful experience. It was not only a great workout but also a valuable lesson in how to collaborate effectively with others, making it one of the most impressive courses I've ever attended.

>  Ok, so, today I'd like to talk about an interesting old person I met at my grandma's dinner party. She's my grandma's good friend, Mrs. Li.
> At that dinner, Mrs. Li was sitting right next to me, therefore, naturally we started talking to each other. Surprisingly, despite the age difference, we had a lot of things in common（尽管年龄不同，有很多共同之处）. For example, we both loved traveling, watercolour painting and yoga! That's why we hit it off（投机） right away, which was incredible.
> She was a professional traveler（职业旅行家）, and she had traveled to more than 40 different countries at that time. She shared with me a lot of fascinating stories. She was indeed a great story teller. I was so engaged（听故事时被深深吸引）. 
> I really enjoyed the conversation with her, because, first off, I love traveling. I loved listening to her traveling stories. She was a very open, chatty and charismatic person, at the same time, very knowledgeable with the world（对全世界的知识很博学多闻）. So, I really admired her. And secondly, she was 0 pretentious（装逼的） or self-centred（自我为中心）. You know how sometimes people who have seen and done a lot in life tend to be very arrogant and ego-centric（傲慢且自我）, and they make everything about themselves（一切话题都是关于他们的）? Mrs. Li was not like that at all. On the contrary, she was a great listener（善于倾听）, and she cared about my stories. She was humble and down-to-earth.

Anna has always been someone who loves DIY projects and is incredibly **crafty**, so I think this would be the perfect gift for her. She enjoys hands-on activities that allow her to build or create something from scratch, and this model would definitely **capture her interest**.
>
> The chocolate factory model is a unique and intricate design. It's made from high-quality wood, and the pieces are laser-cut, which makes it very precise and easy to assemble.  The model actually has **moving parts**. Once completing the assembly,  we can see marbles, served as chocolate beans, roll through the structure, mimicking the process of chocolate being made in a factory. There are little gears and mechanisms that make the marbles move along a track, and when it's all put together, the factory **comes to life in a fun and charming way**.
>
> I think Anna would absolutely love this gift for several reasons. First, she enjoys **working with her hands**, so assembling this model would be a fun challenge for her. The fact that it's a chocolate factory theme would also appeal to her because she has a **sweet tooth**, and the idea of creating something that's related to chocolate is quite fitting. Secondly, I know that she appreciates gifts that are **thoughtful and personalized**, and this one would show that I understand her hobbies and interests.
>
> Moreover, this model would serve as both a **relaxing activity** and a **decorative** piece once it's completed. It's the kind of thing that she could proudly **display** on her shelf, and every time she looks at it, she'd remember the fun process of building it. I can imagine her spending hours working on it, and I'm sure she'd enjoy every step of the journey, from the assembly to watching the marbles roll.
>
> Overall, I think a DIY wooden chocolate factory assembly model would be a wonderful gift for Anna. It's not only creative and fun, but it also aligns perfectly with her interests. I'm sure she'd appreciate the thoughtfulness behind it and enjoy the experience of building it.

>  Today, I'd like to talk about **Zhang Guimei**, a truly inspiring individual who has made a remarkable impact on society. Zhang is a Chinese educator and the founder of the **Huaping High School for Girls**, which was the first free high school exclusively for girls in China. Her dedication to education, especially for underprivileged girls in rural areas, is nothing short of extraordinary.
>
> Zhang Guimei has spent **over two decades** working tirelessly in the remote, mountainous regions of Yunnan province, where many families face economic difficulties. The area she chose to work in is incredibly impoverished, and girls there are often forced to drop out of school due to financial constraints or societal expectations. What's truly commendable about her work is that she not only focuses on providing free education but also **personally visits** families to persuade them to allow their daughters to attend school. In some cases, she even uses her own limited income to help pay for students'expenses.
>
> Her efforts have **transformed countless lives**. Many of her students, who would have otherwise been confined to a life of hardship, have gone on to pursue higher education and secure stable careers. Zhang's selflessness has not only empowered individual girls but also uplifted entire families and communities.
>
> What I find most inspiring about Zhang Guimei is her relentless **commitment to social equality**. Despite battling health issues, including cancer, she continues to devote her life to ensuring that girls from impoverished backgrounds have access to education. She firmly believes that education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, and her actions reflect that belief.
>
> In recognition of her contributions, she has received numerous national awards, including being named one of the “**People's Role Models**” in China. However, I think what truly sets her apart is her genuine compassion and her willingness to **sacrifice her own well-being for the greater good**.
>
> To sum up, Zhang Guimei is a true inspiration and a shining example of how one person's dedication and hard work can change society for the better. Her story reminds us that, with enough passion and determination, we can all make a positive difference in the world.

And explain how you felt about the experience

>  I'd like to talk about a time when I used my smartphone to do something really important. This happened just a few months ago during a offline academic lecture. It was an important session for one of my courses, and I was relying on my laptop to take notes. But, unfortunately, halfway through the lecture, my laptop suddenly ran out of battery. I hadn't realized it was so low, and I didn't have my charger with me at that moment.
>
> At first, I panicked because I didn't want to miss any critical information from the lecture. It was a session led by a guest lecturer, so I knew it wasn't something that would be easily repeated. That's when I decided to use my smartphone to salvage the situation. I quickly took out my phone, using the notes app to jot down key points.
>
> What really surprised me was how effective my phone turned out to be for taking notes. Of course, the screen was much smaller than my laptop's, but the phone's keyboard was responsive, and I was able to type relatively quickly. I even found it convenient to use voice typing for some parts, which allowed me to capture information even faster. Additionally, I could switch between apps seamlessly to check references and details the lecturer mentioned during the talk.
>
> In the end, I managed to take detailed notes without missing much of the lecture, which was **a huge relief**. I was actually proud of myself for staying calm and adapting to the situation. I realized that my phone is more than just a device for communication or entertainment; it's a powerful tool that can be incredibly useful in unexpected situations.
>
> After that experience, I made it a habit to keep my phone fully charged during important events, and I've even started using it more often for taking notes or accessing online resources when I'm on the go. It was a lesson in being resourceful and making the most of what I had at the moment. It might have been a small incident, but it definitely left a lasting impression on how versatile smartphones can be for academic purposes.

#### （46）向长者学习的技能

Describe a skill that you learned from older people

You should say:

What the skill is

Who you learned it from

How you learned it

And how you feel about it

>  One skill that I learned from an older person is **how to make rice dumplings**, which I learned from my grandmother. In my culture, rice dumplings, or "zongzi" as we call them, are traditionally made to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, and it's a skill that's been passed down through generations.
>
> I first learned this skill a few years ago when I visited my grandmother during one of my school holidays. Growing up, I had always been fascinated by how she would so effortlessly wrap the dumplings with bamboo leaves, filling them with sticky rice, red beans, and pieces of marinated meat. So, one day, I asked her to teach me how to make them, and she was more than happy to pass on her knowledge.
>
> The process was much more **challenging** than I had anticipated. First, my grandmother showed me how to **soak the sticky rice overnight**（将糯米浸泡一夜） and prepare the fillings, making sure they were well-seasoned（把馅料调味好）. The most difficult part, though, was **folding the bamboo leaves into a neat triangular shape** and securing them with string. My initial attempts were clumsy; the leaves would slip, and the filling would **spill out.** However, my grandmother was very patient. She guided me step by step, demonstrating how to fold the leaves tightly and tie the string so that the dumplings wouldn't fall apart during boiling.
>
> What I really appreciated about learning this skill from my grandmother was not just mastering the technique but also hearing the **stories and traditions** behind it. She shared how her mother taught her, and how, back in the day, families would gather to make these dumplings together, turning it into a cherished tradition. It made me realize that making rice dumplings isn't just about the food itself, but also about **family bonding and preserving cultural heritage**.
>
> Since learning this skill, I've tried making rice dumplings on my own a few times, especially during the Dragon Boat Festival, to share with friends and family. Although I'm not nearly as skilled as my grandmother, I've definitely improved. What makes me happiest is seeing the smiles on people's faces when they taste the dumplings I've made—it's a small way for me to **keep our family tradition alive**.
>
> Looking back, I'm grateful for the time I spent with my grandmother learning this skill. It's not just a practical cooking technique but also a **connection to my roots** and a way to honor the past. I hope to continue making rice dumplings and maybe one day pass on this skill to younger members of my family.

>  I'd like to talk about a trip I once took to the countryside outside of St. Petersburg, Russia. It was during the summer a few years ago when I had the opportunity to visit this serene and picturesque area. 
>
> The place I visited was a small village called Pavlovsk. It's famous for its stunning imperial park and palace, which were once the summer residence of the Russian Tsars. The village itself had an old-world charm, with quaint wooden houses, gardens bursting with colorful flowers, and narrow, winding roads. It was such a refreshing change from the busy and bustling city life of St. Petersburg.
>
> What struck me most about the countryside there was how peaceful and quiet it was. As I walked along the park's shaded paths, I could hear nothing but the rustle of leaves and birds chirping. The air was incredibly fresh, and the scent of pine trees and wildflowers was everywhere. A lake in the park is surrounded by tall birch trees reflected in the calm, mirror-like water. It felt like I was stepping back in time to a simpler, more relaxed era.
>
> I also had the chance to interact with some of the locals, who were warm and welcoming. They even invited me to try some traditional Russian dishes, like blini and borscht, made from fresh ingredients grown in their gardens. This experience made the trip even more memorable because it gave me a glimpse into their way of life, which is so deeply connected to nature.
>
> Overall, visiting the countryside near St. Petersburg was a truly unforgettable experience. It gave me a much-needed break from the city's fast-paced environment and allowed me to immerse myself in the natural beauty and history of the area. I would love to go back one day, especially in autumn when the leaves change color, as I imagine it would be even more breathtaking.
