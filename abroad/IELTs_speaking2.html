<h4 id="1colors16">（1）Colors（1.6）<a class="headerlink" href="#1colors16" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>What's your favorite color?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>My favorite color is light green. I find it incredibly refreshing and calming at the same time. It gives me a sense of vitality, as it reminds me of nature, like fresh leaves in spring or a peaceful meadow. At the same time, it has a quiet and soothing quality that helps me feel relaxed, especially when I'm stressed. I think it's a perfect balance between energy and tranquility, which is why I'm drawn to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>What's the color you dislike? Why?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not really fond of brown. To me, it often looks a bit dirty and too dark, which makes it feel dull and unappealing. While I understand some people find it earthy and natural, it just doesn't resonate with me. I prefer colors that are more vibrant or calming, so brown isn't something I'd choose for my clothes or decor.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What colors do your friends like most?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of my friends don't have a strong preference for a particular color. They tend to choose colors based on the occasion or what suits them at the moment. For example, some might wear bright colors for a party but go for neutral tones like white or gray in their daily lives. I think they're quite flexible when it comes to colors.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>What color makes you uncomfortable in your room?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd feel uncomfortable if my room were painted black. It's just too dark and gloomy for me, and it might even make the space feel smaller than it actually is. I associate black with depression or a lack of energy, so I'd much prefer lighter, more uplifting colors like light green or pastel tones to create a positive atmosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Have you ever bought something because of its color?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I've never bought anything solely because of its color. I'm more practical when it comes to shopping, so I prioritize functionality over appearance. For example, when I buy clothes or gadgets, I focus on whether they meet my needs rather than how they look. That said, if something has a nice color and is functional, it's definitely a bonus!</p>

<h4 id="2borrowing-lending16">（2）Borrowing/ Lending（1.6）<a class="headerlink" href="#2borrowing-lending16" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever borrowed books from others?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I've borrowed books from others, especially when I was in school or university. It's a great way to access resources without having to buy them, and I've always made sure to return the books in good condition. Borrowing books also gives me a chance to explore new topics or authors that I might not have considered otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have you ever borrowed money from others?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I've never borrowed money from others. I prefer to manage my finances carefully and avoid situations where I might need to rely on someone else for financial help. If I ever face a financial challenge, I'd try to find a solution on my own first, like cutting expenses or saving more.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you like to lend things to others?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I'm generally willing to lend things to others, especially if it's something they genuinely need. I believe in helping people out when I can, whether it's lending a book, a tool, or even offering advice. However, I do expect the person to return the item in good condition and within a reasonable time frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>How do you feel when people don't return things they borrowed from you?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>It depends on what they borrowed. If it's something small, like a pen or a notebook, I'd probably just let it go and not make a big deal. But if it's something more valuable or important, I'd be quite upset and might even go to their home to demand it back. In such cases, I'd also think twice before lending them anything again in the future.</p>

<h4 id="3hats-caps19">（3）Hats/ Caps（1.9）<a class="headerlink" href="#3hats-caps19" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Is wearing hats popular in your country?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, wearing hats is quite popular in my country. Many people wear different types of hats to match their outfits and enhance their overall style. For example, in the summer, you'll often see people wearing wide-brimmed 宽帽檐 hats or baseball caps to protect themselves from the sun while still looking fashionable. In winter, beanies and woolen hats are common because they're both practical and stylish. I think hats are a great way to add a touch of charm and personality to an outfit, so it's no surprise they're so popular.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Where do you like to buy hats?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>online, convenient </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What kind of hats do you have?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically 2 kinds of hats. In the summer, I like to wear baseball caps because they're great for keeping the sun off my face and providing some shade. On the other hand, during the winter, I switch to knitted hats, as they help keep me warm and protect my ears from the cold. I find both styles not only practical but also easy to match with my outfits.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you like to wear hats?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>not a big fan of hats, wear hats for its practical value</p>

<h4 id="4stories">（4）Stories<a class="headerlink" href="#4stories" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>What stories did you like when you were young?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was young, I was really into fantasy and fairy tales. I loved how these stories were full of imagination, magic, and often had themes of love and adventure. They transported me to different worlds where anything was possible, and I found that incredibly exciting. Stories like <em>Cinderella</em> or <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> were my favorites because they allowed me to dream big and escape reality for a while.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you prefer listening to stories or reading them?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I definitely prefer reading stories over listening to them. When I read, I can take my time to understand the plot and characters at my own pace, and I enjoy the tactile experience of holding a book or flipping through pages. It feels more personal and immersive. On the other hand, while listening to stories is easier and more convenient, especially when multitasking, I find it harder to fully engage with the story compared to reading.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="5gifts">（5）Gifts<a class="headerlink" href="#5gifts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I've sent handmade gifts to others, such as handmade cards. I think they're more personal and meaningful compared to store-bought items. Creating something by hand shows effort and thoughtfulness, which I believe makes the gift more special for the recipient.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have you ever received a great gift?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I've received some great gifts in the past. One that stands out is a personalized photo album from a close friend. It was filled with memories from our time together, and I really appreciated the time and effort they put into creating it. It's something I still cherish today.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What do you consider when choosing a gift?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When choosing a gift, I consider the receiver's personality and hobbies. I try to pick something that reflects their interests or something they've mentioned wanting. For example, if they enjoy reading, I might choose a book by their favorite author. I believe a thoughtful gift shows that you truly understand and care about the person.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I think I'm good at choosing gifts. I pay attention to what people like and try to find something that suits their tastes or needs. I've received positive feedback from friends and family, which makes me feel confident in my ability to pick meaningful and appreciated gifts.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>What gift have you received recently?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, I received a down jacket as a gift. It was both practical and thoughtful, especially since winter was approaching. I really appreciated it because it showed that the person considered my needs and wanted to make sure I stayed warm during the cold season.</p>

<h4 id="6party">（6）Party<a class="headerlink" href="#6party" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>

<h4 id="7apps">（7）Apps<a class="headerlink" href="#7apps" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>What apps have you recently used?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I've recently used Taobao and Red Note. Taobao is a popular Chinese e-commerce platform where I often buy daily necessities, clothes, and tech gadgets. Red Note, on the other hand, is a social app I use to  share my personal thoughts and browse notes posted by others. It helps me find many interesting things.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>What kinds of apps are you usually interested in?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm generally interested in productivity and lifestyle apps. For instance, I enjoy using note-taking apps, task managers, and calendars to stay organized. I also like fitness tracking apps that help me monitor my exercise routines and sleep. I believe these types of apps help me be more efficient and maintain a balanced life.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>How do you find out different apps?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I usually discover new apps through the app gallery on my phone or through recommendations from friends and social platforms. Sometimes, I'll read reviews on tech blogs or forums where people share their experiences with various apps. If an app is highly rated or frequently mentioned, I'm more likely to give it a try.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>What kinds of apps would you like to use in the future?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In the future, I'd like to explore more apps related to personal finance management and mental well-being. I think apps that can help with budgeting or investment would be useful for better financial planning. Also, I'm interested in meditation or mindfulness apps that could assist me in reducing stress and improving my focus.</p>

<h4 id="8housework-and-cooking">（8）Housework and cooking<a class="headerlink" href="#8housework-and-cooking" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Do you do some cooking/help your family cook at home now?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually, no, I don't know how to cook at the moment. I've never really had to, since my family usually takes care of meals. I'm not much of a cook, but I do enjoy eating well-prepared food, and I sometimes help with basic tasks like setting the table or cleaning up afterward.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Did you do some house cleaning when you were young?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, when I was younger, I was responsible for some basic house cleaning tasks. I would help out with sweeping, dusting, and tidying up my room. It wasn't something I enjoyed particularly, but my parents made sure I contributed to keeping the house in order.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you have breakfast at home every day?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Not really. Since I live on campus now, I don't always have breakfast at home. Sometimes I have it at the school canteen, and other times I might skip it if I'm in a hurry or don't feel like eating early in the morning.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you want to learn how to cook well?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, definitely. I think cooking is a really practical and useful skill to have. Not only is it cost-effective, but it also allows you to eat healthier and try different kinds of food. I would love to learn how to cook some basic meals at least.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Do you think your home is clean and tidy?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, it's probably not always as clean and tidy as I'd like it to be. I try to keep things organized, but with the busy schedule of studying, sometimes things pile up. It's more or less tidy, but definitely not spotless.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>What housework do you like or dislike doing?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Frankly, I don't really enjoy housework at all. I find tasks like washing dishes or cleaning the floors a bit tedious. If I had to choose, I suppose I don't mind doing some light organizing or wiping down surfaces, but anything that requires too much effort isn't something I look forward to.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you like quiet or noisy places?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer quiet places because they help me relax and focus. For example, I enjoy reading or studying in a quiet environment where I can concentrate without distractions. However, I don’t mind noisy places occasionally, especially if I’m with friends or at a social event.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Would you like to go to quiet or noisy places on weekends when you are free?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>On weekends, I usually prefer quiet places, like a park or a café, where I can unwind and recharge after a busy week. However, if I’m in the mood for something lively, I might go to a noisy place, like a concert or a busy market, for a change of pace.</p>

<li>Did you enjoy traveling by car when you were a kid?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I absolutely loved traveling by car when I was a kid. It was always exciting because it usually meant we were going somewhere fun, like an amusement park or a scenic spot. I remember feeling a sense of adventure and anticipation during those trips, and I'd often look out the window, enjoying the view and imagining what the destination would be like.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>What types of cars do you like?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm particularly fond of big SUV cars, like Jeeps. They're not only comfortable but also very spacious, which makes long journeys much more enjoyable. I also like how they're designed for both city driving and off-road adventures, giving a sense of versatility and freedom. Plus, they feel safer and more robust compared to smaller cars.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you prefer to be a driver or a passenger?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer being a passenger rather than a driver. Driving can be quite tiring, especially on long trips, and it requires a lot of focus. As a passenger, I can relax, enjoy the scenery, and even take a nap if I want to. It's a much more stress-free experience, and I can fully appreciate the journey without worrying about the road.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>What do you usually do when there is a traffic jam?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When there's a traffic jam, I usually try to make the most of the time by taking a nap or watching TV dramas on my phone. It's a good way to kill time and stay entertained, especially if the jam lasts for a while. Sometimes, I also listen to music or podcasts to keep myself relaxed and distracted from the frustration of being stuck in traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Do you think car colors are important?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I think car colors are quite important. For certain vehicles, like police cars or ambulances, the color combination serves a functional purpose, making them easily recognizable in emergencies. For private cars, the color often reflects the owner's personality or style. For example, someone who chooses a bright red car might be seen as bold and energetic, while a black or white car might suggest a more classic or sophisticated taste.</p>

<li>Do you like looking at yourself in the mirror? How often?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I do like looking at myself in the mirror, and I do it several times a day. Mostly, it's to check my attire and make sure I look presentable before leaving the house or attending an event. It's become a habit for me to quickly glance in the mirror to ensure everything is in place, like my hair or outfit.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Have you ever bought mirrors?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I've bought a small mirror before. I have one in my dormitory that I use for daily grooming, like styling my hair or applying skincare products. It's compact and convenient, so it doesn't take up much space, which is perfect for a small living area like a dorm room.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you usually take a mirror with you?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, not really. I don't feel the need to carry a mirror with me all the time. I think it's unnecessary because I don't have to check my appearance constantly. If I really need to, I can use my phone's camera or find a mirror in public places like restrooms.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Would you use mirrors to decorate your room?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I wouldn't use mirrors to decorate my room, especially not in front of the bed. In Chinese culture, it's considered unlucky to place a mirror directly opposite the bed, as it's believed to bring negative energy or disturb sleep. So, I'd avoid using mirrors for decorative purposes in my room, even though they can make spaces look bigger and brighter.</p>

<li>Is there an advertisement that made an impression on you when you were a child?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there's one advertisement that left a lasting impression on me when I was a child. It was for a brand of mineral water, and what made it memorable was its unique storytelling approach. The ad featured a man and a woman trapped in a rock cave, and while the story was dramatic and engaging, it didn't seem to have much to do with the water itself. I remember being fascinated by the creativity, even though I didn't fully understand the connection at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you see a lot of advertising on trains or other transport?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I see a lot of advertising on public transport, especially on subways. There are posters and digital screens everywhere. It's hard to miss them because they're strategically placed in high-traffic areas, like inside the train cars or on the platform walls. While some ads are creative, others can feel a bit overwhelming due to their sheer volume.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you like advertisements?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, not really. I find that advertisements often consume a lot of my time without adding much value to my life. For example, when I'm watching a video or browsing online, ads can interrupt the experience, and most of them don't seem relevant to me. While I understand their purpose, I generally find them more annoying than helpful.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>What kind of advertising do you like?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer storytelling ads that don't directly promote a specific product. These ads often use creative narratives or emotional themes to engage the audience, making them more memorable and enjoyable to watch. For example, I've seen ads that tell a heartwarming story or showcase a unique concept, and only at the end do they subtly introduce the product. I find this approach much more appealing than traditional ads that simply push a product in your face.</p>

Without a computer, it would be almost impossible to keep up with my coursework.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">

<p>The first time I used a computer was in grade 3, during an IT class at school. I remember being fascinated by how it worked and feeling excited to learn something so modern and advanced at the time. That class introduced me to basic functions like typing and using simple software, which sparked my interest in technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What would your life be like without computers?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I honestly can't imagine my life without computers. They've become such an integral part of daily life, not just for me but for everyone. For example, I rely on them for studying, communication, and even entertainment. Without computers, tasks would take much longer, and many modern conveniences we take for granted would simply disappear. It would feel like going back in time.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>In what conditions would it be difficult for you to use a computer?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be difficult to use a computer while traveling, especially if there's no proper desk or stable surface to place it on. For instance, on a crowded train or bus, it's hard to balance a laptop and focus on the screen. Additionally, if there's no reliable internet connection or power source, using a computer becomes inconvenient or even impossible.</p>

<p>Yes, I've seen quite a few old buildings in the city center. In my city, there are still some traditional residential areas called <em>Nongtang</em> in Chinese. These buildings have a unique architectural style and reflect the city's history and culture. Walking through these areas feels like stepping back in time, and it's fascinating to see how people lived in the past.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you think we should preserve old buildings in cities?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I strongly believe we should preserve some old buildings because of their historical and cultural value. They serve as a reminder of the city's heritage and help us understand how life used to be. Additionally, they often attract tourists, which can benefit the local economy. However, it's also important to balance preservation with modern development to meet the needs of a growing population.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you prefer living in an old building or a modern house?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I definitely prefer living in a modern house. Modern buildings are designed with convenience and comfort in mind, featuring amenities like elevators, better insulation, and advanced facilities. Old buildings, while charming, often lack these modern comforts and can be less practical for daily living. For me, functionality and comfort are more important than historical appeal when it comes to choosing a place to live.</p>

<p>No, I don't often feel bored because I always keep myself busy and try to find something new to do. Whether it's studying, working on a project, or exploring a new hobby, I make sure my time is filled with meaningful activities. I think staying productive and curious helps me avoid boredom.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>When would you feel bored?</li>

<blockquote>
<p>I usually feel bored when I don't have a clear plan or goal and don't know what to pursue. For example, if I have a free day with no schedule or tasks, I might feel a bit lost and end up doing nothing productive. In those moments, boredom creeps in because I lack direction or motivation.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>What do you do when you feel bored?</li>

<p>When I feel bored, I usually browse social media platforms like Red Note or Weibo to pass the time. Sometimes, I also try to pick up a new hobby, like cooking or painting, to keep myself engaged. These activities help me break the monotony and add a bit of excitement to my day.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Do you think childhood is boring or adulthood is boring?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I think adulthood is more boring compared to childhood. As a child, life was carefree and full of curiosity, with no major responsibilities. However, adulthood is often dominated by work, family obligations, and routine, which can feel monotonous over time. While adulthood has its rewards, it lacks the spontaneity and freedom that made childhood so exciting.</p>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If I find something lost by others, I would take it to the lost and found office. I think it's the most practical and responsible way to handle the situation, as it increases the chances of the item being returned to its owner. If there's no lost and found office nearby, I might <strong>hand it over</strong> to the manager or staff of the place where I found it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you report to the police when finding something lost by others? Why?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I usually don't report to the police immediately when I find something lost. Instead, I'd first take it to the lost and found office or inform the manager of the place where I found it. Reporting to the police would be <strong>my last resort</strong>, especially if the lost item is very expensive or valuable, like a wallet or a phone. I think this approach is more efficient and avoids unnecessary complications.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Have you ever lost things?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I've lost things quite a few times. When I was in primary school, I often lost small items like erasers or rulers because I wasn't very organized back then. In college, I once lost my keys, which was quite stressful because I needed them to access my dorm room. Luckily, I found them after retracing my steps, but it taught me to be more careful with my belongings.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Will you post on social media if you lose your item?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I would post about it on social media, especially on platforms like my school forum or community groups. I think it's a quick and effective way to reach a large number of people who might have seen or found the lost item. It's also a way to appeal to the kindness of others, as someone might come across the post and help me recover what I've lost.</p>

<p>Friends are very important to me. They provide emotional support, companionship, and a sense of belonging. Whether I'm going through a tough time or celebrating a success, having friends to share those moments with makes life more meaningful and enjoyable.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you often go out with your friends?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I go out with my friends several times a year, especially during holidays or special occasions. It's a great way to <strong>catch up</strong>, relax, and create lasting memories together. While we might not meet as often as we'd like due to busy schedules, we always make the most of our time together.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Where do you often meet each other?</li>
</ol>

<p>We often meet at interesting sites, like parks or tourist spots, or at shopping malls. These places offer a variety of activities, from dining and shopping to simply walking around and chatting. It's a nice way to combine fun and relaxation while spending time together.</p>
</blockquote>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>When I'm with my friends, we usually eat out, play games, or watch movies. These activities are enjoyable and allow us to bond over shared experiences. Sometimes, we also try new activities together, like hiking or attending events, to keep things fresh and exciting.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Do you prefer to spend time with one friend or with a group of friends?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer spending time with a group of friends because it's more dynamic and fun. Being in a group allows for more diverse conversations and activities, and it's always interesting to see how everyone interacts. However, one-on-one time with a close friend can also be special for deeper conversations.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Would you invite friends to your home?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I would definitely invite friends to my home. I'm always glad when they visit, as it's a more personal and comfortable setting to spend time together. Whether it's for a meal, a movie night, or just hanging out, having friends over creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do you often read books? When?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I often read books in my spare time, usually in the evening or at night. It's a relaxing way to unwind after a busy day, and I enjoy immersing myself in a good story or learning something new from non-fiction books.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Are your reading habits now different than before?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, my reading habits have changed over time. Now, I mostly read electronic books rather than physical ones. E-books are more convenient because I can carry multiple books on my device and read them anytime, anywhere. However, I still appreciate the feel of a physical book occasionally. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Have you ever read a novel that has been adapted into a film?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, I've read <em>The Wandering Earth</em>, which was adapted into a film. Interestingly, I watched the movie first and then read the book. While the movie was visually stunning, the book provided more depth and detail, which made the story even more engaging.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which do you prefer, reading books or watching movies?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I prefer reading books because they allow me to use my imagination and engage more deeply with the story. Books often provide more details and insights into the characters and plot, which I find more satisfying than the condensed version typically presented in movies.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Do you read more or less now than when you were younger?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I think I read less now than when I was younger. Back then, I had more free time and fewer responsibilities, so I could spend hours reading. Now, with schoolwork and other daily commitments, it's harder to find time to read as much as I'd like. However, I still try to make reading a regular part of my routine.</p>

<p>My favorite place to sit is definitely the sofa. It's soft, comfortable, and perfect for relaxing after a long day. Whether I'm watching TV, reading a book, or just chatting with friends, the sofa is my go-to spot for comfort.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Do you always sit down for a long time?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>No, I try not to sit for long periods because I know it's unhealthy. Prolonged sitting can lead to back pain and other health issues, so I make an effort to stand up, stretch, or take short walks throughout the day. It's important to stay active, even if I'm working or studying.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li>Do you feel sleepy when you are sitting down?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, I do feel sleepy when sitting down, especially if I haven't had enough sleep the night before. The comfort of the sofa or a cozy chair can make it tempting to doze off, but I try to stay awake and focused if I have tasks to complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>When you were a kid, did you usually sit on the floor?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>In my memory, I didn't usually sit on the floor as a kid. I preferred sitting on chairs or sofas, as they were more comfortable. However, I do remember sitting on the floor occasionally while playing with toys or games, but it wasn't a regular habit.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Do you find it easy to fall asleep when sitting on a sofa?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I rarely sleep on the sofa because I prefer sleeping in bed. While the sofa is comfortable, it's not ideal for a proper nap or a good night's sleep. If I'm really tired, I might doze off on the sofa for a short while, but I always try to move to my bed for a more restful sleep.</p>

<li>Would you keep old things for a long time? Why?</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, I tend to keep old things for a long time, especially if they have sentimental value or have been with me for many years.

<p>Who this person is</p>
<p>How you knew this person</p>
<p>Why you think this person is energetic</p>
<p>And explain how you feel about this person</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An energetic person I know is my cousin, who is five years younger than me. He's a <mark>lively and enthusiastic</mark> boy who always seems to have endless energy. One of his favorite activities is playing basketball. He spends hours on the court, whether it's practicing his shots, playing with his friends, or just enjoying the game.</p>
<p>Apart from basketball, he loves going out with his friends to explore new places or try different activities. He's the kind of person who's always <mark>on the move</mark>, whether it's walking the dog in the park or organizing group outings. What really impressed me is how he manages to <mark>keep up his energy</mark> even after a busy day.</p>
<p>I think what makes him so energetic is his positive attitude. He's always <mark>cheerful and looks for the fun side of things,</mark> which inspires others around him. Spending time with him is never boring because his energy is so <mark>contagious</mark>.</p>
<p>Overall, my cousin's lively personality and active lifestyle make him stand out. He motivates me to stay active and enjoy life more, which is why I admire his energetic spirit so much.</p>

<p><strong>1. What kinds of jobs need a lot of physical work?</strong>
Jobs that require a lot of physical work typically include construction work, farming, manufacturing, and roles in the service industry like cleaning or delivery services. These jobs often involve heavy lifting, long hours of standing, or repetitive tasks that demand physical strength and endurance. For example, construction workers need to carry heavy materials and operate machinery, while farmers spend hours in the fields under challenging weather conditions. These roles are essential for society but can be quite demanding on the body.</p>
<p><strong>2. What's the difference between the payment for physical work and that for mental work?</strong>
Generally, jobs that require mental work, such as those in technology, finance, or management, tend to offer higher salaries compared to physical labor jobs. This is because mental work often involves specialized skills, education, and decision-making responsibilities, which are highly valued in the job market. On the other hand, physical work, while equally important, is sometimes seen as less specialized and more replaceable, which can lead to lower wages. However, there are exceptions, such as skilled tradespeople or athletes, who can earn significant incomes due to their expertise or physical abilities.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can physical workers receive higher salaries in the future?</strong>
It's possible, but it depends on several factors. For instance, if there's a shortage of physical workers in certain industries, their salaries might increase due to higher demand. Additionally, as automation becomes more common, skilled physical workers who can operate or maintain advanced machinery might see their wages rise. However, in many cases, physical work may still be undervalued compared to mental work unless there's a significant shift in how society perceives and rewards these roles.</p>
<p><strong>4. Do you think machines could replace human workers in the future?</strong>
Yes, to some extent, machines are already replacing human workers, especially in repetitive or dangerous tasks. For example, in manufacturing, robots are now commonly used for assembly lines, and in agriculture, machines can harvest crops more efficiently. However, I don't think machines will completely replace humans because many jobs require creativity, emotional intelligence, and complex decision-making, which machines cannot replicate. Instead, I believe the future will involve humans working alongside machines to improve productivity and safety.</p>
<p><strong>5. Do you think you are an energetic person?</strong>
Yes, I consider myself an energetic person. I'm always eager to <mark>take on new challenges</mark> and stay active, whether it's at work, during exercise, or in my personal life. I find that being energetic helps me stay motivated and productive, and I enjoy pushing myself to achieve my goals. However, I also make sure to balance my energy with proper rest and relaxation to avoid burnout.</p>
<p><strong>6. Do you think there was more physical labor in the past than there is now?</strong>
Absolutely. In the past, physical labor was much more common because many tasks had to be done manually due to the lack of technology. For example, farming, construction, and manufacturing relied heavily on human effort. However, with the advancement of technology and automation, many of these tasks are now performed by machines, reducing the need for physical labor. While physical work still exists, it's less prevalent than it used to be, and more people are now engaged in mental or service-oriented jobs.</p>
<h4 id="2">（2）近期日常改变<a class="headerlink" href="#2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Describe a positive change that you have made recently in your daily routine</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the change is</p>
<p>How you have changed the routine</p>
<p>Why you think it is a positive change</p>
<p>And explain how you feel about the change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A positive change I recently made to my daily routine is <mark>adjusting my sleep schedule</mark>. I used to stay up late almost every night, spending hours browsing apps like Red Book to entertain myself. While it was fun at the time, I realized it <mark>left me feeling tired and unproductive</mark> the next day.</p>
<p>Now, I've set my mind to getting up early and sleeping early. At first, it was challenging to break the habit, but I started by setting a strict bedtime and avoiding using my phone before bed. Instead, I read a book or listen to relaxing music to <mark>wind down</mark>.</p>
<p>This change has made a big difference in my life. Waking up early gives me extra time in the morning to prepare for the day, whether it's exercising, eating a proper breakfast, or planning my tasks. I also feel more energized and focused throughout the day, which has <mark>improved my productivity and overall mood</mark>.</p>
<p>Looking back, I'm glad I made this change. It's a small adjustment, but it has had a positive impact on both my physical and mental health. I now feel more in control of my time and enjoy my days much more.

<p><strong>1. What do people normally plan in their daily lives?</strong>
People usually plan a variety of activities in their daily lives, such as work or study schedules, household chores, exercise routines, and social engagements. For example, many people plan their work tasks to meet deadlines, schedule time for grocery shopping or cooking, and allocate time for hobbies or relaxation. Additionally, some people plan their commutes or childcare arrangements to ensure everything runs smoothly. Planning helps individuals stay organized and manage their time effectively, especially when balancing multiple responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is time management very important in our daily lives?</strong>
Yes, time management is crucial in our daily lives because it helps us prioritize tasks, avoid procrastination, and achieve our goals efficiently. Without proper time management, people might feel overwhelmed, miss deadlines, or struggle to balance work and personal life. For instance, students need to manage their time to complete assignments and prepare for exams, while working professionals must juggle meetings, projects, and personal commitments. Good time management can reduce stress and improve productivity, making it an essential skill for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>3. What changes would people often make?</strong>
People often make changes to their routines, habits, or lifestyles to improve their well-being or achieve specific goals. For example, someone might change their diet to eat healthier, adjust their sleep schedule to get more rest, or start exercising regularly to stay fit. Others might change their work habits, such as organizing their tasks better or setting clearer priorities. Additionally, people might make changes to their social lives, like spending more time with family or pursuing new hobbies. These changes are usually aimed at enhancing quality of life or addressing challenges.</p>
<p><strong>4. Do you think it is good to change jobs frequently?</strong>
No, I don't think it's good to change jobs frequently because it takes a lot of time and effort to adapt to a new workplace, learn new skills, and build relationships with colleagues. Frequent job changes can also make it difficult to establish a stable career path or gain deep expertise in a particular field. Employers might also view this as a lack of commitment. However, there are exceptions—if someone is unhappy in their current role or finds a better opportunity, changing jobs can be beneficial. But overall, stability is usually more advantageous in the long term.</p>
<p><strong>5. Who do you think would make changes more often, young people or old people?</strong>
I think young people are more likely to make changes frequently because they are still exploring their options and figuring out what they want in life. For example, young people might change jobs, move to new cities, or try different hobbies as they seek new experiences and opportunities. On the other hand, older people tend to be more settled in their routines and preferences, so they might make fewer changes unless necessary. However, this isn't always the case, as some older individuals might also embrace change to adapt to new circumstances or pursue personal growth.</p>
<p><strong>6. Who should get more promotion opportunities in the workplace, young people or older people?</strong>
I believe both young and older people should have equal opportunities for promotion, as it should depend on their skills, performance, and contributions rather than their age. Younger employees might bring fresh ideas, energy, and technological expertise, while older employees often have valuable experience, wisdom, and leadership qualities. A fair workplace should recognize and reward talent and hard work regardless of age. This approach not only fosters a positive work environment but also ensures that the organization benefits from the strengths of all its employees.</p>

<p><strong>1. Why do some children not like learning science at school?</strong>
Some children might not enjoy learning science because they find it too abstract or difficult to understand. Science often involves complex concepts, formulas, and theories that can be challenging to grasp, especially if the teaching methods are not engaging. Additionally, if students don't see the practical applications of science in their daily lives, they might lose interest. For example, learning about chemical reactions or physics principles might seem irrelevant to them if they can't connect it to real-world scenarios. A lack of hands-on experiments or interactive activities in the classroom can also make science seem boring or intimidating.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is it important to study science at school?</strong>
Yes, studying science at school is extremely important because it helps students develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a better understanding of the world around them. Science teaches us how things work, from the human body to the environment, and it encourages curiosity and innovation. For instance, learning about biology can help students understand health and nutrition, while studying physics can explain everyday phenomena like electricity or motion. Moreover, science education is essential for preparing students for careers in fields like medicine, engineering, and technology, which are crucial for societal progress.</p>
<p><strong>3. Which science subject is the most important for children to learn?</strong>
It's hard to say which science subject is the most important because each one—biology, chemistry, and physics—plays a vital role in understanding different aspects of life. However, I would argue that biology might be the most relevant for children because it directly relates to their health, the environment, and living organisms. For example, learning about the human body, ecosystems, or genetics can help children make informed decisions about their well-being and the world they live in. That said, chemistry and physics are equally important for understanding materials, energy, and technology, so a balanced approach is ideal.</p>
<p><strong>4. Should people continue to study science after graduating from school?</strong>
Yes, I believe people should continue to study science even after graduating because scientific knowledge is constantly evolving, and staying informed helps individuals make better decisions in their personal and professional lives. For example, understanding new medical research can improve health choices, while learning about climate science can encourage environmentally friendly behaviors. Additionally, science literacy is essential for critically evaluating information in the media, such as news about vaccines or renewable energy. Lifelong learning in science can also inspire curiosity and innovation, which are valuable in any field.</p>
<p><strong>5. How do you get to know about scientific news?</strong>
I usually get scientific news from reliable online sources, such as science-focused websites, news platforms, or social media accounts of reputable organizations. For example, I follow platforms like BBC Science, National Geographic, or scientific journals that summarize research in an accessible way. I also watch documentaries or YouTube channels that explain complex topics in a simple and engaging manner. Occasionally, I attend public lectures or webinars hosted by universities or research institutions to stay updated on the latest discoveries and advancements.</p>
<p><strong>6. Should scientists explain the research process to the public?</strong>
Yes, I think scientists should explain their research process to the public because it helps build trust and understanding. Many scientific concepts can be complex, and without clear explanations, people might misunderstand or distrust scientific findings. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, clear communication about vaccine development was crucial to address public concerns and encourage vaccination. By explaining the research process in simple terms, scientists can make their work more accessible and demonstrate its relevance to everyday life. This also encourages public support for scientific endeavors and fosters a culture of curiosity and learning.</p>

<p><strong>1. What do you think of national identity?</strong>
National identity is an important concept because it reflects a sense of belonging and shared culture among people from the same country. It includes elements like language, traditions, history, and values that unite individuals and give them a sense of pride. For example, celebrating national holidays or participating in cultural events can strengthen this identity. However, I think it's also important to balance national identity with global awareness, as being too focused on one's own culture can sometimes lead to a lack of understanding or appreciation for other cultures.</p>
<p><strong>2. What are the advantages of working in an international company?</strong>
Working in an international company offers several advantages. First, it provides exposure to diverse cultures and perspectives, which can enhance creativity and problem-solving skills. For example, collaborating with colleagues from different backgrounds can lead to innovative ideas and approaches. Second, it often offers opportunities for professional growth, such as training programs, international assignments, or networking with global experts. Finally, working in such an environment can improve communication and adaptability, as employees learn to navigate cultural differences and work effectively in multicultural teams.</p>
<p><strong>3. How does travelling abroad affect young people?</strong>
Travelling abroad can have a profound impact on young people. It broadens their horizons by exposing them to new cultures, languages, and ways of thinking, which can foster open-mindedness and tolerance. For example, experiencing different lifestyles or traditions can challenge their assumptions and help them appreciate diversity. Additionally, travelling can build independence and confidence, as young people learn to navigate unfamiliar environments and solve problems on their own. It also provides valuable life experiences that can shape their personal and professional development.</p>
<p><strong>4. How do people get information about other countries?</strong>
People can get information about other countries through various sources, such as the internet, books, documentaries, and social media. For instance, travel blogs, news websites, and platforms like YouTube offer insights into different cultures, traditions, and current events. Additionally, talking to people who have visited or lived in other countries can provide firsthand perspectives. Educational programs, such as history or geography classes, also play a role in teaching people about the world. Overall, the availability of diverse resources makes it easier than ever to learn about other countries.</p>
<p><strong>5. Do you think reading is a good way to get to know other countries? Why?</strong>
Yes, I think reading is an excellent way to learn about other countries because it provides in-depth and reliable information. Books, whether they are travel guides, historical accounts, or novels, offer detailed insights into a country's culture, history, and society. For example, reading a novel set in a specific country can give readers a sense of its traditions, values, and daily life. Additionally, reading allows people to explore topics at their own pace and reflect on what they've learned, making it a more immersive and thoughtful way to understand other cultures.</p>
<p><strong>6. What do you think makes countries different?</strong>
Countries differ in many ways, including their cultures, traditions, languages, and histories. For example, customs like food, festivals, and social norms vary widely from one country to another. Additionally, geographical factors, such as climate and natural resources, influence how people live and interact with their environment. Political systems and economic conditions also play a role in shaping a country's identity and development. These differences make each country unique and contribute to the rich diversity of the world, which is something to be celebrated and respected.</p>

<p>Describe an important decision that you made</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the decision was</p>
<p>How you made your decision</p>
<p>What the results of the decision were</p>
<p>And explain why it was important</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, I made a very hard decision of breaking up with（提分手） my boyfriend. Now he's my ex-boyfriend. Coming to think of it, it turned out to be an important decision in my life and it was definitely the right thing to do/ it was a good call（是正确的选择）.</p>
<p>We had been together for about three years, and during that period of time, I was in two minds（犹豫，纠结） all the time. <em>On one hand</em>, he was funny and charming. He could really make me laugh. I loved his sense of humor （我喜欢他的幽默感） and his charisma. <em>On the other hand</em>, he was a control freak. He always wanted me to listen to him, and say yes to him. He really put a lot of pressure on me. I mean, I'm an independent person with an independent mind, so I couldn't just blindly follow his commands（跟随他的指令）. He was very bossy（霸道的） and macho（大男子主义的）.</p>
<p>I <strong>was torn between</strong>（很纠结） leaving and staying. I didn't want to rush into the decision（匆忙做决定）, so I waited long enough because I wanted to give it a chance. After being together for three years, I was very unhappy, so I finally made up my mind（彻底下决定） to leave him. I told him about my decision. It wasn't easy for me. I was crying and having a meltdown when I saw him for the last time. And he refused to take it. We were not <strong>on the same page</strong> at all（意见不一致，他不想分手）.</p>
<p>After the breakup, in the beginning, he was still trying to influence my decision by constantly calling me and trying to see me. It was extremely difficult for me to not pick up the phone. But I pulled myself together（振作起来）. I didn't give him any chances to talk to me. And eventually, after 6 months, he gave up.
 I'm now feeling so much better without him. <mark>Everything is water under the bridge</mark>（事情都过去了）. Even though I still miss him sometimes, I know it will all be over one day. Time will heal everything（时间会治愈一切）. It was a tough decision to make, but it was the right thing to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Do you think children sometimes have to make important decisions?</strong>
Yes, I believe children sometimes have to make important decisions, although these decisions might not seem as significant from an adult's perspective. For example, children might need to decide which extracurricular activities to join, how to manage their time between schoolwork and hobbies, or how to handle conflicts with friends. These decisions can shape their personal development and teach them valuable life skills like responsibility and problem-solving. While adults often guide them, children still play a key role in making choices that affect their daily lives.</p>
<p><strong>2. What important decisions do teenagers need to make after graduation?</strong>
After graduation, teenagers face several important decisions that can significantly impact their future. One of the most critical decisions is choosing a career path or field of study, which often involves selecting a university or vocational training program. They also need to decide whether to enter the workforce immediately or pursue further education. Additionally, teenagers might have to make decisions about their personal lives, such as managing finances, living independently, or balancing work and social commitments. These choices require careful thought and planning, as they lay the foundation for their adult lives.</p>
<p><strong>3. Who can children turn to for help when making a decision?</strong>
Children can turn to various people for help when making decisions, depending on the situation. Most commonly, they seek guidance from their parents or guardians, who have more experience and can offer advice based on their own lives. Teachers and school counselors are also valuable resources, especially for decisions related to education or career paths. Additionally, children might consult friends or siblings for support, particularly when dealing with social or personal issues. Having a network of trusted individuals helps children feel more confident and informed when making decisions.</p>
<p><strong>4. Do you think advertisements can influence our decisions when shopping?</strong>
Yes, advertisements can significantly influence our shopping decisions because they are designed to attract attention and create a desire for products. For example, advertisements often use persuasive techniques like emotional appeals, celebrity endorsements, or limited-time offers to convince consumers to buy something. They can also shape our perceptions of a product's quality or value, even if we weren't initially interested in it. While some people are more resistant to advertising, it's hard to deny that it plays a powerful role in shaping consumer behavior.</p>
<p><strong>5. Do you think the influence of advertising is good?</strong>
The influence of advertising can be both positive and negative. On the positive side, advertisements can inform consumers about new products, services, or innovations that might improve their lives. For example, ads for eco-friendly products can raise awareness about sustainability. However, advertising can also have negative effects, such as promoting unrealistic beauty standards or encouraging excessive consumption. Additionally, some ads might be misleading or manipulative, leading people to make poor purchasing decisions. Overall, the impact of advertising depends on how it's used and the intentions behind it.</p>
<p><strong>6. How do people usually make important decisions?</strong>
People usually make important decisions by gathering information, weighing the pros and cons, and considering their goals and values. For example, someone deciding on a career might research different fields, seek advice from mentors, and reflect on their interests and skills. Emotions and intuition also play a role, as people often rely on their gut feelings when faced with tough choices. Additionally, discussing the decision with trusted friends or family members can provide new perspectives and help clarify thoughts. Ultimately, the process varies depending on the individual and the complexity of the decision.</p>
<h4 id="6">（6）学校/工作中的重要规则<a class="headerlink" href="#6" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Describe a rule that is important in your school or at work</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the rule is about</p>
<p>What happens when people break the rule</p>
<p>Why you think it is an important rule</p>
<p>And explain how you feel about the rule</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One important rule in my school is that students are not allowed to use mobile phones during class. This rule is meant to ensure that everyone stays focused on their studies instead of getting distracted by social media, games, or chatting with friends.</p>
<p>If someone breaks this rule, the teacher usually <mark>confiscates</mark> their phone for the rest of the day. In more serious cases, the school might inform the student's parents or even <mark>impose a temporary ban on bringing phones to school</mark>. This is quite an effective way to enforce discipline, as no one wants to lose access to their phones.</p>
<p>I believe this rule is essential because it helps maintain <mark>a good learning environment</mark>. Nowadays, mobile phones can be very distracting, and once a student starts scrolling through social media or texting, it's hard to pay attention to the lesson. Also, banning phones in class encourages students to <mark>interact with each other</mark> face-to-face rather than relying on digital communication all the time.</p>
<p>Personally, I have mixed feelings about this rule. On one hand, I understand its purpose and agree that it helps us concentrate better. On the other hand, there are times when I need my phone to check something important, like a dictionary or study materials. However, overall, I think it is a reasonable rule that benefits most students in the long run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. What rules should children follow at home in your country?</strong>
In my country, children are typically expected to follow several rules at home to ensure discipline and harmony. For example, they are often required to complete their homework before playing or using electronic devices. They are also expected to help with household chores, such as cleaning their rooms or setting the table for meals. Additionally, respecting elders, speaking politely, and adhering to bedtime schedules are common rules. These rules help children develop responsibility, time management skills, and good manners, which are essential for their personal growth.</p>
<p><strong>2. On what occasions can children be forgiven if they don't follow some rules?</strong>
Children can usually be forgiven for breaking rules if it's their first time or if they didn't fully understand the rule. For example, if a child accidentally spills something while trying to help with chores, parents might be more lenient. Similarly, during special occasions like birthdays or festivals, rules might be relaxed to allow children to enjoy themselves. Additionally, if a child is unwell or going through a difficult time, parents might show more understanding and flexibility. Forgiveness in such situations helps maintain a positive and supportive family environment.</p>
<p><strong>3. What rules should people follow when using public transport?</strong>
When using public transport, people should follow several rules to ensure safety and comfort for everyone. For instance, they should queue politely when boarding and give priority to elderly, pregnant, or disabled passengers. It's also important to keep noise levels low, avoid eating or drinking, and keep the area clean. Additionally, passengers should follow safety guidelines, such as holding onto handrails and staying behind marked lines on platforms. These rules help create a pleasant and efficient public transport experience for all users.</p>
<p><strong>4. What kinds of rules do people need to follow in public places?</strong>
In public places, people need to follow rules that promote safety, cleanliness, and respect for others. For example, they should avoid littering, respect noise restrictions, and follow designated smoking areas. In places like parks or museums, people are expected to stay on marked paths, avoid damaging property, and follow instructions from staff. Additionally, social etiquette, such as being polite and considerate of others, is important in maintaining a harmonious environment. These rules ensure that public spaces remain enjoyable and accessible for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>5. What are the reasons that cause people to break rules?</strong>
People might break rules for various reasons, such as lack of awareness, convenience, or rebellion. For instance, someone might not know about a specific rule or misunderstand its importance. Others might break rules to save time or effort, like jaywalking (乱穿马路) to avoid a long detour. In some cases, people might intentionally break rules as a form of protest or to challenge authority. Stress or emotional distress can also lead to rule-breaking, as individuals might act impulsively without considering the consequences. Understanding these reasons can help address the root causes of rule violations.</p>
<p><strong>6. When people break rules, how would they be punished in your country?</strong>
In my country, the punishment for breaking rules depends on the severity of the violation. For minor offenses, such as littering or noise complaints, people might receive a warning or a fine. More serious violations, like breaking traffic laws or damaging public property, can result in heavier fines, community service, or even legal action. In schools or workplaces, rule-breakers might face disciplinary measures like suspension or loss of privileges. The goal of these punishments is to discourage rule-breaking and encourage individuals to act responsibly.</p>

<p>Describe your grandparents'job</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>what it was</p>
<p>how long he or she had this job</p>
<p>how he or she got the job</p>
<p>what skills this job needs</p>
<p>and whether you would like to have this job in the future</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to talk about my grandmother, who was a farmer for most of her life. She worked in agriculture, growing crops like rice, wheat, and vegetables on a small family farm in the countryside. She had this job for over 40 years, starting when she was very young and continuing until she retired in her late 60s.</p>
<p>My grandmother got into farming because it was a family tradition. Her parents were also farmers, so she learned the skills and knowledge from them from a very early age. She didn't <mark>have a formal education in agriculture</mark>, but she had a lot of <mark>practical experience and understood the land</mark>, the seasons, and how to grow different crops.</p>
<p>Being a farmer requires a wide range of skills. For example, you need to be physically strong because farming involves a lot of manual labor, like planting, harvesting, and <mark>carrying heavy loads</mark>. You also need to be patient and resilient because farming depends heavily on the weather, and sometimes crops can fail due to droughts or floods. Additionally, my grandmother had to be very <mark>resourceful and creative in solving problems</mark>, like finding ways to protect crops from pests or managing limited resources.</p>
<p>As for whether I'd like to have this job in the future, I don't think so. While I deeply respect my grandmother's hard work and dedication, farming is a very <mark>demanding</mark> job, both physically and mentally. I also think it's quite unpredictable because of factors like climate change, which makes it even more challenging. However, I do admire the connection to nature and the sense of independence that comes with farming. <mark>It's just not the right career path for me personally.</mark></p>

<p>Describe a time you made a promise to someone</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the promise was</p>
<p>To whom you made it</p>
<p>Whether it was easy or difficult to keep</p>
<p>And explain why you made it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to talk about a promise I made to my cousin a few years ago. At the time, she was preparing for her final high school exams, and she was feeling extremely <mark>stressed and overwhelmed</mark>. She had always struggled with math, and she was worried that she wouldn't be able to pass the exam. One evening, she came to me, almost in tears, and asked for my help. I promised her that I would tutor her every day until her exams and help her improve her math skills.</p>
<p>After I made the promise, I felt <mark>a strong sense of responsibility</mark> to keep it. At first, I thought it would be easy because I was confident in my own math abilities, but it turned out to be more challenging than I expected. I had to sacrifice a lot of my free time to sit with her, explain concepts, and practice problems. There were moments when I felt frustrated because she didn't grasp things as quickly as I hoped, but I reminded myself of the promise I had made and pushed through.</p>
<p>The reason I made this promise was because <mark>I could see how much it meant to her</mark>. She trusted me to help her, and I didn't want to let her down. I also knew how important these exams were for her future, and I wanted to do everything I could to support her. In the end, she managed to pass her math exam with a decent grade, and she was incredibly grateful for my help. Seeing her relief and happiness made all the effort worthwhile.</p>
<p>This experience taught me the importance of keeping promises, especially when they involve someone who depends on you. It also <mark>strengthened my relationship</mark> with my cousin, as she knew she could count on me when she needed help the most.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Why do some people fail to keep their promises?</strong>
There are several reasons why people might fail to keep their promises. Sometimes, it's due to unforeseen circumstances, such as sudden illness or emergencies, which make it impossible to follow through. Other times, people might overcommit themselves and realize they don't have the time or resources to fulfill their promises. In some cases, a lack of sincerity or responsibility can also lead to broken promises, as individuals might make commitments without intending to keep them. Additionally, poor communication or misunderstandings can result in promises being unintentionally broken.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do children keep their promises?</strong>
Children often try to keep their promises, but their ability to do so depends on their age, maturity, and understanding of the commitment. Younger children might struggle to keep promises because they are still learning about responsibility and the importance of follow-through. For example, a child might promise to clean their room but get distracted by playing. However, as children grow older and develop a stronger sense of accountability, they are more likely to keep their promises, especially if they understand the consequences of breaking them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do parents in China make promises to their children?</strong>
Yes, parents in China, like parents everywhere, often make promises to their children. These promises can range from small, everyday commitments, like buying a toy or taking them to the park, to more significant ones, such as rewarding good grades or planning a family vacation. Promises are often used as a way to motivate children or encourage positive behavior. However, Chinese parents generally emphasize the importance of keeping promises to teach their children about trust and responsibility, as these values are deeply rooted in Chinese culture.</p>
<p><strong>4. What kinds of promises do people often make?</strong>
People make a wide variety of promises depending on the context. In personal relationships, promises often revolve around emotional commitments, such as being supportive or staying loyal. In professional settings, promises might include meeting deadlines, delivering quality work, or fulfilling contractual obligations. On a daily basis, people might make smaller promises, like showing up on time or helping a friend with a task. Additionally, people often make promises to themselves, such as committing to a healthier lifestyle or learning a new skill. These promises reflect the values and priorities of individuals in different aspects of life.</p>

<p>Describe a line (or a few words) that you remember from a poem or song</p>
<p>You should say</p>
<p>What it is</p>
<p>Which song or poem it is from</p>
<p>How you knew it</p>
<p>And explain how you feel about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One line that has always stayed with me is from Shakespeare's <em>Sonnet 18</em>. The line is, <strong>“Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?”</strong> It's the opening line of the sonnet, and it's one of the most famous lines in English literature. The poem itself is a beautiful tribute(致敬) to the timeless beauty of a loved one, and this line sets the tone for the entire piece.</p>
<p>I first came across this poem in high school during an English literature class. We were studying Shakespeare, and our teacher had us analyze several of his sonnets. This one stood out to me because of its <mark>romantic and poetic language</mark>. I remember being struck by how simple yet profound the opening line was. It immediately draws you in and makes you curious about what the comparison will be.</p>
<p>The reason this line resonates with me so much is because of its <mark>elegance and universality</mark>. It's a question that feels both personal and timeless as if Shakespeare is speaking directly to the reader. <mark>I also love how it captures the fleeting beauty of summer and contrasts it with the eternal beauty of the person he's describing</mark>. It's a reminder of how powerful words can be in expressing emotions and ideas.</p>
<p>Whenever I think of this line, I feel a sense of admiration for Shakespeare's ability to convey such deep feelings in just a few words. It also makes me appreciate the beauty of poetry and how it can connect people across time and cultures. Even though the poem was written centuries ago, its message still feels relevant and moving today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Are you good at memorizing things?</strong>
I would say I'm fairly good at memorizing things, especially if they interest me or if I can connect them to something meaningful. For example, I find it easier to remember lyrics to songs I enjoy or facts related to topics I'm passionate about. However, I struggle with memorizing random or abstract information unless I use techniques like repetition, visualization, or creating associations. Overall, my ability to memorize depends on the context and how much effort I put into it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do you think children would like the rhythm of songs or poems? Why?</strong>
Yes, I think children are naturally drawn to the rhythm of songs and poems because it makes the content more engaging and fun. The repetitive and melodic nature of rhymes and rhythms helps capture their attention and makes it easier for them to remember the words. For example, nursery rhymes or children's songs often use simple, catchy patterns that appeal to young listeners. Additionally, the rhythm adds an element of playfulness, which aligns with children's love for creativity and imagination.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do you think it is easier for children to learn a song or poem than adults? Why?</strong>
Yes, I believe it's generally easier for children to learn songs or poems compared to adults. Children have a more flexible and receptive mind, which allows them to absorb new information quickly. They are also less self-conscious and more willing to engage with creative and repetitive activities, which aids memorization. On the other hand, adults might overthink or struggle to find time to practice due to their busy schedules. However, adults who are motivated or have a strong interest in music or poetry can still learn effectively.</p>
<p><strong>4. What can people learn from songs or poems?</strong>
People can learn a great deal from songs and poems, as they often convey emotions, stories, and cultural values. For example, songs and poems can teach us about history, traditions, and social issues, providing insights into different perspectives and experiences. They also help improve language skills, such as vocabulary, pronunciation, and rhythm. Additionally, songs and poems can inspire creativity, empathy, and self-expression, allowing people to connect with their own emotions and those of others. Overall, they are powerful tools for both education and personal growth.</p>

<p>And how you felt about the change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to talk about a recent change in my plans regarding my future career and education. This happened just last month when I was faced with a big decision about my next steps after graduating from college.</p>
<p><mark>Originally</mark>, my plan was to start looking for a job right after graduation. I had already begun preparing my resume and researching companies in my field. However, last month, I attended a seminar about studying abroad, and it completely changed my perspective. The speaker shared their experiences of studying overseas, and I realized how much it could <mark>broaden my horizons, both academically and personally</mark>. After giving it some serious thought, I decided to change my plan and <mark>pursue a master's degree abroad</mark> instead of entering the job market immediately.</p>
<p>The new plan involves applying to universities in countries like the UK or Canada, which are known for their excellent programs in my field. I've started preparing for language tests like IELTS and researching scholarships to fund my studies. It's a big shift from my original plan, but I feel it's the right decision for my long-term growth.</p>
<p>At first, I felt a bit <mark>anxious</mark> about the change because it meant <mark>stepping out of my comfort zone and delaying my entry into the workforce</mark>. However, as I started researching and talking to people who had studied abroad, I became more <mark>excited and confident</mark> about this new direction. I believe this change will <mark>open up more opportunities</mark> for me in the future, and I'm looking forward to the challenges and experiences that come with studying in a different country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Do people often change their plans?</strong>
Yes, people often change their plans due to various reasons. Sometimes, unexpected circumstances like bad weather, illness, or work emergencies can force them to adjust their schedules. Other times, people might change their plans because they find better alternatives or simply change their minds. For example, someone might decide to stay home instead of going out if they feel tired or if a more appealing opportunity arises. Flexibility is a natural part of life, and adapting to changes is essential for managing priorities effectively.</p>
<p><strong>2. Would you tell others if you change your plan?</strong>
Yes, but only to those who are directly affected by the change or are important to me. For instance, if I cancel a meeting with a friend, I would inform them immediately to avoid inconvenience. Similarly, if I change plans that involve family or colleagues, I would let them know as soon as possible. However, for plans that don't impact others, I might not feel the need to share the change. Communication is key to maintaining trust and ensuring that everyone is <mark>on the same page</mark>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why do you think parents still make plans for their children nowadays?</strong>
Parents often make plans for their children because they want to ensure their well-being and success. For example, they might plan their education, extracurricular activities, or even future careers to provide them with the best opportunities. Parents also make plans to instill discipline and structure in their children's lives, which they believe will help them grow into responsible adults. Additionally, some parents might feel that their experience and knowledge can guide their children in making better decisions, especially in a competitive and fast-changing world.</p>
<p><strong>4. How does technology help people make plans?</strong>
Technology plays a significant role in helping people make and manage plans efficiently. For instance, calendar apps and reminder tools allow individuals to organize their schedules, set deadlines, and receive notifications about upcoming events. Communication platforms like email or messaging apps make it easy to coordinate plans with others, even across long distances. Additionally, travel and booking apps help people plan trips, accommodations, and activities seamlessly. Overall, technology simplifies the planning process and ensures that people can stay organized and informed.</p>

It’s a <mark>modern, energy-efficient unit</mark> that we installed a couple of years ago, and while we don’t use it every day, it has become an essential part of our lives, especially during extreme weather.</p>
<p>We primarily rely on the air conditioner during the summer and winter months. In the summer, when the temperature can get extremely high, the air conditioner is a <mark>lifesaver</mark>. It keeps our home cool and comfortable, making it possible to <mark>relax and sleep without feeling overwhelmed by the heat</mark>. Similarly, during the winter, when it gets uncomfortably cold, we use the air conditioner to maintain a warm and cozy indoor environment. Even though we don’t use it year-round, it’s during these seasons that we truly appreciate its value.</p>
<p>The air conditioner is important to us for several reasons. First, it significantly <mark>improves our quality of life</mark> by keeping our home at a comfortable temperature during extreme weather.

<p>I'd like to talk about the Oriental Pearl TV Tower in Shanghai, which is one of the most <mark>iconic landmarks</mark> in China. Located in the Pudong district of Shanghai, it stands along the Huangpu River and is surrounded by other impressive skyscrapers, making it a central part of the city's stunning skyline.</p>
<p>The Oriental Pearl TV Tower is a unique and futuristic-looking building. It's incredibly tall, standing at 468 meters, and its design is inspired by a poem about pearls falling onto a jade plate. The tower consists of several large spheres at different levels, connected by vertical columns, which give it a distinctive and elegant appearance. At night, the tower is illuminated with colorful lights, making it even more striking and visually appealing.</p>
<p>The tower serves multiple functions. Primarily, it's a TV and radio broadcasting tower, but it has also become a major tourist attraction. Inside, there are observation decks that offer <mark>breathtaking views of Shanghai</mark>, as well as a revolving restaurant where visitors can enjoy a meal while taking in the <mark>panoramic(全景的)  scenery</mark>. Additionally, the tower houses a museum dedicated to the history of Shanghai, which adds an educational element to its appeal.</p>
<p>What makes the Oriental Pearl TV Tower so interesting to me is its <mark>combination of architectural innovation, cultural significance, and functionality</mark>. It's not just a building; it's a symbol of Shanghai's rapid development and modernization. Every time I visit, I'm amazed by how it blends art, technology, and history into one structure. It's a must-see for anyone visiting Shanghai, and it never fails to leave a lasting impression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>**1. What types of buildings are popular in your country? **
In China, ancient buildings are highly popular and admired for their cultural and historical significance. Traditional Chinese architecture, such as palaces, temples, and courtyard homes, reflects the country's rich heritage. For example, the Forbidden City in Beijing and the ancient water towns in Suzhou are iconic examples of Chinese architecture, featuring intricate designs, wooden structures, and symbolic elements like curved roofs and dragon motifs. These buildings are not only tourist attractions but also serve as a reminder of China's artistic and engineering achievements throughout history.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is it worth spending a lot of money on the exterior appearance of a building?</strong>
Spending money on the exterior appearance of a building can be worth it, depending on the purpose and context. For iconic structures like museums, government buildings, or cultural landmarks, an impressive exterior can enhance their significance and attract visitors. However, for residential or functional buildings, it's more important to balance aesthetics with practicality and cost-effectiveness. While a visually appealing exterior can create a positive impression, the focus should also be on <mark>durability, sustainability, and the building's overall functionality</mark>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Is it more important for a building to look good on the outside or on the inside?</strong>
I believe the inside of a building is more important than the outside because it directly impacts the comfort and usability of the space. A well-designed interior ensures that the building meets the needs of its occupants, whether it's for living, working, or leisure. For example, good lighting, ventilation, and layout are essential for creating a functional and pleasant environment. That said, the exterior appearance is also important, as it contributes to the building's identity and can influence people's perceptions. Ideally, a balance between the two should be achieved.</p>
<p><strong>4. Why do people like to visit historical sites?</strong>
People visit historical sites for various reasons. Firstly, these sites offer a glimpse into the past, allowing visitors to learn about history, culture, and traditions. For example, exploring ancient ruins or castles can provide insights into how people lived centuries ago. Secondly, historical sites often have <mark>unique architectural and artistic value</mark>, making them visually captivating. Additionally, visiting such places can <mark>evoke a sense of connection to one's heritage</mark> or inspire awe at human achievements. Lastly, historical sites are often surrounded by stories and legends, which add an element of intrigue and fascination.</p>

<p>Mysterious lotus casebook（莲花楼，武装古侠悬疑剧）</p>
<p>I'd like to talk about a TV series called <em>Mysterious Lotus Casebook</em>, which is a Chinese historical mystery drama. I watched it last year, and it quickly became one of my favorite shows because of its <mark>intriguing plot and well-developed characters.</mark></p>
<p>The series is set in fictional ancient China and follows the story of a <mark>brilliant but enigmatic</mark> detective who solves complex cases while uncovering secrets from his own past.

<p><strong>1. Is it beneficial to insert advertisements within a TV series?</strong>
Inserting advertisements within a TV series can be beneficial for broadcasters and advertisers, but it often disrupts the viewing experience for the audience. For broadcasters, ads generate revenue, which helps fund the production of high-quality content. Advertisers also benefit by reaching a large and engaged audience. However, for viewers, frequent ad breaks can be frustrating, especially during intense or emotional scenes. While ads are necessary for the industry, finding a balance between commercial interests and viewer satisfaction is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do you think that parents should limit their children from watching television?</strong>
Yes, I believe parents should limit their children's television time to ensure a healthy balance between screen time and other activities. Excessive TV watching can lead to issues like reduced physical activity, poor sleep quality, and exposure to inappropriate content. However, television can also be educational if children watch age-appropriate programs that stimulate their curiosity and learning. Parents should set reasonable limits and encourage alternative activities, such as reading, playing outdoors, or engaging in creative hobbies, to promote overall development.</p>
<p><strong>3. Would your family watch TV together?</strong>
Yes, my family occasionally watches TV together, especially during special occasions or when there's a program that interests everyone. For example, we might watch a popular reality show, a sports event, or a movie during weekends or holidays. Watching TV together provides an opportunity for bonding and shared enjoyment. However, due to busy schedules and differing preferences, it's not something we do every day. When we do, it's a relaxing and enjoyable way to spend quality time as a family.</p>
<p><strong>4. What are the differences in television viewing habits between the elderly and young people?</strong>
There are significant differences in television viewing habits between the elderly and young people. Elderly individuals often prefer traditional TV channels and watch programs like news, dramas, or documentaries at scheduled times. They tend to value the routine and familiarity of linear TV. On the other hand, young people are more likely to use streaming platforms like BiliBili or YouTube, where they can watch content on demand and binge-watch entire series. They also prefer genres like reality shows, comedies, or online videos, reflecting their desire for convenience and entertainment tailored to their interests.</p>
<p><strong>5. How has technology changed the way people watch television?</strong>
Technology has revolutionized the way people watch television by introducing on-demand streaming, personalized content, and multi-device accessibility. Platforms like iQIYI and youku allow viewers to watch their favorite shows anytime, anywhere, without being tied to a TV schedule. Smart TVs and devices like Roku or Chromecast have made it easier to access a wide range of content. Additionally, social media and recommendation algorithms help users discover new shows based on their preferences. Overall, technology has made television viewing more flexible, interactive, and user-centric.</p>

<p><strong>1. What kinds of emotional support do people need at work?</strong>
People need various types of emotional support at work to maintain their well-being and productivity. For example, they might need encouragement and recognition for their efforts, especially during challenging projects or stressful periods. A supportive work environment where colleagues and managers listen to their concerns and offer constructive feedback is also crucial. Additionally, flexibility and understanding during personal difficulties, such as family issues or health problems, can make a significant difference. Emotional support helps employees feel valued, motivated, and less overwhelmed, which ultimately benefits both the individual and the organization.</p>
<p><strong>2. Would you share your feelings with your coworkers?</strong>
It depends on the situation and the level of trust I have with my coworkers. If I'm close to them and feel comfortable, I might share my feelings, especially if it's related to work stress or a collaborative project. However, I would be cautious about oversharing personal emotions, as maintaining professionalism is important in the workplace. In general, I believe open communication can strengthen teamwork and create a supportive atmosphere, but it's essential to strike a balance and respect boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>3. Is it possible to know a job applicant's emotional resilience through the recruiting process?</strong>
Yes, to some extent, it is possible to assess a job applicant's emotional resilience during the recruiting process. For example, behavioral interview questions that ask about past challenges and how they were handled can provide insights into their ability to cope with stress and adversity. Additionally, situational judgment tests or role-playing exercises can reveal how candidates manage pressure and solve problems in real-time. However, emotional resilience is complex and may not be fully understood until the person is actually in the role and facing day-to-day challenges.</p>

<p><strong>1. Which do you think is better? A detective movie or its original novel?</strong>
I think it depends on personal preference, but I would argue that the original novel is often better. Novels allow readers to immerse themselves in the story, explore the characters'  thoughts and motivations, and use their imagination to visualize the scenes. Detective novels, in particular, often include intricate details and clues that can be more engaging when read at one's own pace. However, detective movies can also be enjoyable because they bring the story to life with visuals, sound, and acting, making the experience more dynamic and accessible.</p>
<p><strong>2. Why are detective stories attractive to people?</strong>
Detective stories are attractive because they stimulate curiosity and engage the mind. People enjoy the challenge of solving mysteries alongside the characters, piecing together clues, and trying to predict the outcome before it's revealed. The suspense and tension in these stories create a thrilling experience that keeps readers or viewers hooked. Additionally, detective stories often explore themes of justice, morality, and human psychology, which add depth and make them intellectually and emotionally rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>3. What kinds of puzzles improve people's intelligence?</strong>
Puzzles like crosswords, Sudoku, and logic games are great for improving intelligence because they enhance problem-solving skills, memory, and critical thinking. Jigsaw puzzles can improve spatial awareness and patience, while riddles and brain teasers encourage creative thinking and mental flexibility. Strategy-based puzzles, such as chess or escape room challenges, also help develop planning and decision-making abilities. These activities stimulate different parts of the brain, making them effective tools for cognitive development.</p>
<p><strong>4. Why do parents let their children play puzzles?</strong>
Parents encourage their children to play puzzles because they are both fun and educational. Puzzles help children develop essential skills like problem-solving, hand-eye coordination, and concentration. They also teach patience and perseverance, as children learn to work through challenges step by step. Additionally, puzzles can be a great way for children to bond with family members or friends, fostering social skills and teamwork. Overall, puzzles are a valuable tool for promoting cognitive and emotional growth in a playful and engaging way.</p>
<p><strong>5. How can technology and intellectual games be combined better?</strong>
Technology and intellectual games can be combined better by creating interactive and immersive experiences. For example, mobile apps and online platforms can offer personalized puzzles and games that adapt to the user's skill level, making them more engaging and effective. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) can also be used to create realistic and challenging environments for problem-solving and strategy games. Additionally, incorporating elements like gamification, where users earn rewards or compete with others, can motivate people to engage more deeply with intellectual games.</p>
<p><strong>6. Does the government need to take steps to boost the development of intellectual games?</strong>
Yes, I believe the government should support the development of intellectual games because they have significant educational and social benefits. Funding research and innovation in this field can lead to the creation of more effective and accessible games that promote cognitive development and lifelong learning. The government could also encourage schools to incorporate intellectual games into their curricula to enhance students'  critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, organizing public events or competitions centered around intellectual games can raise awareness and make them more popular among people of all ages.</p>

<p><strong>1. Is sports important for children?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I believe sports are incredibly important for children, both physically and mentally. On the physical side, sports help children build strength, improve their coordination, and develop healthy habits that can last a lifetime. Regular physical activity also reduces the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Mentally, sports can teach children essential life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Additionally, participating in sports can boost their self-confidence and help them manage stress. In today's digital age, where many children spend excessive time on screens, engaging in sports is even more crucial to ensure they stay active and healthy.</p>
<p><strong>2. How can we make children aware of the importance of sports?</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways we can make children aware of the importance of sports. First, schools and parents can play a significant role by encouraging participation in physical activities from a young age. For instance, schools could offer a wide variety of sports programs so children can find something they enjoy. Additionally, parents should lead by example by engaging in sports themselves, which would inspire their children to do the same. Media campaigns and advertisements promoting the benefits of sports can also be effective, especially when they target children and highlight role models who excel in sports. Finally, creating a positive and supportive environment where children are celebrated for their effort, rather than just their achievements, can motivate them to continue being active.</p>

<p>And explain why you think this person does this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about my uncle, who is really passionate about protecting the environment. He’s an environmental engineer, so he’s always thinking about ways to make the world greener. But what’s really cool is that he doesn’t just talk about it—he actually lives it every day.</p>
<p>For example, he volunteers a lot in our community. He joins beach clean-ups and tree-planting events, and he even gets other people to come along. He also visits local schools to teach kids about recycling and how to waste less. Another thing he’s done is help set up solar panels on some public buildings in our town, which is a great way to use clean energy.</p>
<p>I think my uncle cares so much about the environment because he’s really worried about climate change. He always says that <mark>even small actions can make a big difference if everyone pitches in</mark>. He loves nature and wants to make sure the planet stays healthy for future generations, especially for his own kids.</p>
<p>What I admire most about him is <mark>how he leads by example</mark>. He doesn’t force his ideas on anyone, but just by living his life in an eco-friendly way, he inspires others to do the same. He’s made a real impact in our community, and I think that’s amazing.</p>
<p>In short, my uncle is someone who truly cares about the environment, and I really <mark>look up to him</mark> for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Why can recycling help the environment?</strong></p>
<p>Recycling can help the environment in several ways. First, it reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators, which helps minimize pollution and conserve space. By reusing materials like paper, plastic, and metal, we can also reduce the need to extract raw resources, which is often harmful to ecosystems. Additionally, recycling reduces energy consumption, as processing recycled materials generally uses less energy compared to manufacturing products from virgin materials. This, in turn, helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Overall, recycling plays a crucial role in promoting a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>2. What have people done to damage the environment?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, humans have done a lot to damage the environment over the years. One of the main ways we've harmed the environment is through deforestation, where vast areas of trees are cut down for agriculture, urbanization, or logging. This disrupts ecosystems, contributes to the loss of biodiversity, and accelerates climate change. Another major issue is pollution, whether it's air pollution from industrial activities, plastic pollution in the oceans, or chemical runoff into rivers and lakes. The overuse of fossil fuels has also led to the depletion of natural resources and increased carbon emissions, driving global warming. Additionally, overfishing and the destruction of habitats are contributing to the decline in wildlife populations.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do you think technology can improve environment-related problems?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, technology can definitely play a role in solving many environment-related problems. For example, renewable energy technologies like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, which would lower greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of pollution, advances in waste management and recycling technologies can help reduce the environmental impact of plastic and other materials. Moreover, technologies like electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances can reduce carbon footprints. On a larger scale, environmental monitoring systems powered by technology can help track pollution levels and predict environmental changes, allowing us to take proactive measures. However, while technology can offer solutions, it's important that these innovations are used alongside sustainable practices and policies.</p>
<p><strong>4. Is it important to teach students environmental protection at school?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's incredibly important to teach students about environmental protection at school. Educating children about environmental issues not only raises awareness but also empowers them to make sustainable choices as they grow older. Schools are an ideal place to instill values of environmental responsibility because they can influence students from a young age. By learning about climate change, recycling, and conservation, students can understand the long-term effects of human activities on the planet. Moreover, when students are educated on these issues, they are more likely to adopt eco-friendly habits, encourage others to do the same, and even advocate for policies that protect the environment in the future.</p>

<p>And explain why you want to change the part</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about a new law in my country that bans single-use plastics, like plastic bags and straws. I think it’s a great law because it helps reduce plastic waste, which is a huge problem for the environment.</p>
<p>The law requires businesses to stop using single-use plastics and switch to more eco-friendly alternatives, like paper or <mark>reusable materials</mark>. This is fantastic because it encourages people to <mark>be more mindful of</mark> their waste and helps protect oceans and wildlife from plastic pollution. I’ve already noticed fewer plastic bags in stores, and it feels good to see people using reusable bags instead.</p>
<p>However, there’s one part of the law I’d like to change. Right now, the alternatives to plastic, like paper straws or reusable bags, are more expensive for small businesses and customers. This can be a problem for people with lower incomes or small shops that can’t afford the switch. I think the government should provide <mark>subsidies or discounts</mark> to help businesses and individuals <mark>make the transition</mark> easier.

<p>Overall, I really support this law because <mark>it’s a big step toward a cleaner environment</mark>. But if they could make it more affordable for everyone, I think it would be even better and more effective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Why is law important?</strong></p>
<p>Law is essential because it provides structure and order within society. It establishes clear guidelines for acceptable behavior, helping to prevent chaos and conflict. Laws protect individual rights, such as personal freedom, property, and security, ensuring that people can live in a safe and fair environment. Without law, there would be no system to resolve disputes or punish wrongdoers, which could lead to injustice and inequality. Additionally, laws play a crucial role in maintaining social harmony by setting out rules for how people should interact with each other. In a broader sense, they also help safeguard public health, the environment, and the economy by regulating industries and promoting fairness in business practices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Why are there people who like a law but want to change part of it?</strong></p>
<p>There are often people who appreciate the overall principles of a law but believe certain aspects of it need improvement. This can happen because laws are designed to address a wide range of issues, but they may not always be perfectly suited to every situation. Over time, social values, technology, and circumstances change, and laws that were once appropriate may no longer align with current needs or perspectives. For example, a law that works well in one context might be seen as outdated or unjust in another. People may want to change parts of a law if they feel it's unfair, too restrictive, or if they think it could be more effective in achieving its intended goals. In a democratic society, it's normal for people to question and challenge laws in order to make the system more just and equitable for everyone.</p>

The rest of the cast was fantastic too, and everyone worked so well together that the whole performance felt <mark>real and emotional</mark>.</p>
<p>The musical was a modern version of Shakespeare’s classic story, mixing old and new styles. The songs were beautiful, with some slow, emotional ones and others that were full of energy. The dancing was also really impressive, and the stage design and lighting made it feel like we were actually in Verona, the setting of the story.</p>
<p>I went to see it with my friends during a weekend. We’d been excited about it for weeks, and it didn’t disappoint. The music, acting, and overall production were so good that it made the whole evening unforgettable.</p>
<p>What I loved most was how the performance made the story’s themes of love, conflict, and fate feel so modern and relatable. The actors were so talented, and the whole experience was so well put together that it left a deep impression on me. It was one of those rare moments where everything—the music, the acting, and the atmosphere—just clicked, and I left the theater feeling inspired and moved.</p>

It was a mix of laughter, music, and heartfelt moments. I've also attended graduation parties and casual get-togethers with friends, but birthday parties stand out because they are personal and celebratory, <mark>marking special milestones in life</mark>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do you think it is hard for people to perform in front of their friends?</strong>
Yes, I think performing in front of friends can be challenging for many people because <mark>there's added pressure to impress or meet their expectations</mark>. Friends are often familiar with your personality and abilities, which can make you feel more self-conscious about making mistakes. However, for some, performing in front of friends can also be easier because they feel more supported and encouraged by people they trust. It really depends on the individual's confidence and the nature of their relationship with their friends.</p>
<p><strong>3. Is it easy to invite your friends to attend your party or your performance?</strong>
It's usually easy to invite friends to a party or performance, especially if they are close to you and share similar interests. Most friends are happy to support you and enjoy the occasion together. However, it can sometimes be challenging if they have prior commitments or if the event requires a lot of time or effort. Clear communication and giving them enough notice can make the process smoother and increase the likelihood of their attendance.</p>
<p><strong>4. Is it expensive to watch a live performance in your country?</strong>
The cost of watching a live performance in my country varies <mark>depending on the type of event and the venue</mark>（活动场地）. For example, concerts by international artists or large-scale theater productions can be quite expensive, with ticket prices ranging from moderate to very high. On the other hand, local performances, such as community theater or smaller music gigs, are often more affordable. While some live performances can be costly, many people feel the experience is worth the price because of the unique atmosphere and connection with the performers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Why do many people prefer to watch a live performance rather than watch it on TV?</strong>
Many people prefer live performances because they <mark>offer a unique and immersive experience</mark> that can't be replicated on TV. The energy of the crowd, the interaction with performers, and the spontaneity of live events create a sense of excitement and connection. For example, at a concert, the music feels more powerful, and you can see the artists'  emotions and efforts up close.

<p>I’d like to talk about Sun Yingsha, a Chinese table tennis player who is one of the most talented and inspiring athletes I know. She has achieved remarkable success at a young age, and I truly <mark>admire her dedication and skill</mark>.</p>
<p>I first got to know about Sun Yingsha through watching international table tennis tournaments on TV.

<p><strong>1. Do you think it is very important for students to do sports?</strong>
Yes, I believe it is very important for students to participate in sports. Engaging in physical activities not only improves their physical health but also enhances mental well-being. For example, sports help reduce stress, boost concentration, and promote teamwork and leadership skills. Additionally, <mark>regular exercise can instill discipline and time management</mark>, as students learn to balance academics and extracurricular activities. Overall, sports play a vital role in the holistic development of students, preparing them for challenges both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>2. Does winning in a sports game make students feel proud?</strong>
Yes, winning in a sports game often makes students feel proud because it <mark>validates their hard work, skills, and teamwork</mark>. The sense of achievement and recognition they receive from winning can <mark>boost their confidence and motivation</mark>. For example, scoring the winning goal or leading a team to victory can create lasting memories and a sense of accomplishment. However, it’s important to emphasize that participation and effort are equally valuable, as they teach resilience and sportsmanship, regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do you think winning is everything in sports competitions?</strong>
No, I don’t think winning is everything in sports competitions. While winning can be rewarding, the true value of sports lies in <mark>the lessons learned through participation</mark>, such as teamwork, perseverance, and discipline. For instance, losing a game can teach students how to handle failure gracefully and strive for improvement. Additionally, sports foster friendships, physical fitness, and a sense of community, which are equally important. Focusing solely on winning can lead to unnecessary pressure and detract from the enjoyment and personal growth that sports offer.</p>

<p>Describe a time you enjoyed a free day off work or school
You should say:
Where you were
What you did
Who you were with
And how you felt about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about last weekend when I had a free day off from school and decided to visit West Lake with my roommate. It’s really close to our campus, just a short metro ride away, so we didn’t have to wake up early or rush. It was such a relaxing and fun day, and I really needed the break.</p>
<p>We left in the early afternoon, and the weather was perfect—sunny but not too hot, with a nice breeze. When we got to the lake, the atmosphere was so peaceful. We spent the first part of the day walking around the lake, enjoying the <mark>beautiful views of the water, willow trees, and mountains in the distance</mark>. The scenery was so pretty that we took lots of photos to remember it.</p>
<p>Later, we found a quiet spot by the lake to watch the sunset. The sky turned into amazing shades of orange, pink, and purple, and it reflected on the water, making it look like a painting. It was so peaceful, and I felt completely relaxed. My roommate and I talked about life, school, and our plans for the future, which made the moment even more special.</p>
<p>After the sunset, we <mark>checked out</mark> the nearby shopping area, which has a mix of traditional and modern shops. We bought some souvenirs and tried some local snacks, like <em>dongpo pork</em> and <em>longjing tea</em>. It was a really chill way to end the day, and we didn’t feel rushed at all.</p>
<p>What made this day so great was the combination of beautiful nature, good food, and spending time with my roommate. It helped me forget about school stress and just enjoy the moment. By the end of the day, I felt <mark>refreshed</mark> and happy. It reminded me how important it is to take breaks and appreciate the little things in life.</p>

<p><strong>1. Do people nowadays have more free time than in the past?</strong> 
It’s <mark>debatable</mark> whether people today have more free time than in the past. On one hand, advancements in technology and automation have reduced the time needed for many tasks, such as household chores or commuting. On the other hand, the fast-paced nature of modern life, with its demanding work schedules and constant connectivity, often leaves people feeling busier than ever. While some may have more free time in theory, they might struggle to use it effectively due to stress or distractions like social media.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do you think most people are able to manage their free time well?</strong> 
I think many people struggle to manage their free time effectively. With so many distractions, such as smartphones, social media, and streaming platforms, it’s easy to waste time without realizing it. Additionally, some people find it hard to balance work, family, and personal interests, leading to poor time management. However, those who prioritize planning and self-discipline, such as setting goals or using time management tools, are often more successful in making the most of their free time.</p>
<p><strong>3. What do people like to do when they are free in your country?</strong> 
In my country, people enjoy a variety of activities during their free time. Many prefer relaxing at home, watching TV shows, or browsing social media. Others engage in outdoor activities like hiking, playing sports, or visiting parks. Socializing with friends and family over meals or coffee is also popular. Additionally, some people use their free time for hobbies like reading, painting, or gardening. Younger generations often spend time playing video games or exploring new trends online.</p>
<p><strong>4. What's the difference between the things people did in their free time in the past and the things they do nowadays?</strong> 
In the past, people’s free time activities were often more <mark>community-oriented and physically engaging</mark>. For example, they might gather for local festivals, play traditional games, or spend time outdoors. Nowadays, technology has transformed how people spend their free time, with many opting for <mark>screen-based activities</mark> like watching movies, playing video games, or scrolling through social media. While these activities are convenient, they are often more solitary and less physically active compared to the past.</p>
<p><strong>5. Why is working extra hours common nowadays?</strong> 
Working extra hours has become common due to several factors. Firstly, the competitive job market pushes employees to work harder to secure their positions or advance their careers. Secondly, the rise of technology means people are constantly connected to their work, making it harder to “switch off.” Additionally, some industries have <mark>high workloads or tight deadlines</mark>, requiring employees to put in extra hours. Lastly, financial pressures, such as rising living costs, often force people to take on more work to make ends meet.</p>
<p><strong>6. What can we do to stop working long hours?</strong> 
To reduce long working hours, both individuals and organizations need to take action. Employers can promote a healthier work-life balance by setting clear boundaries, encouraging breaks, and offering flexible work arrangements. Employees should prioritize time management, set realistic goals, and learn to say no to excessive demands. Governments can also play a role by <mark>enforcing labor laws</mark> that limit working hours and protect employees’ rights. Ultimately, fostering a culture that values productivity over long hours is key to addressing this issue.</p>

You should say:
Where it is
How you knew this place
What it is like
And explain why you would like to visit it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about the Amazon Rainforest, which is one of the most fascinating and biodiverse places on Earth. Located primarily in Brazil, the Amazon <mark>spans across</mark> several South American countries and is often referred to as the "lungs of the planet" because of its vast number of trees and its role in producing oxygen.</p>
<p>I first learned about the Amazon Rainforest in school during a geography class. We studied its importance to the global ecosystem, its incredible variety of plant and animal species, and the challenges it faces due to deforestation. Since then, I’ve been intrigued by this place and have watched documentaries and read articles about it, which have deepened my interest.</p>
<p>The Amazon Rainforest is a <mark>lush, green paradise filled with towering trees, dense vegetation, and winding rivers</mark>. It’s home to millions of species, including exotic birds, monkeys, jaguars 美洲虎, and countless insects. The sheer scale of the forest is overwhelming—it’s so vast that it feels like an entirely different world. The sounds of wildlife, the fresh, earthy scent of the forest, and the sight of sunlight filtering through the canopy(森林里天篷似的树荫) create a magical atmosphere.</p>
<p>I would love to visit the Amazon Rainforest because it offers a unique opportunity to <mark>connect with nature on a profound level</mark>. It’s a place where you can truly <mark>escape the hustle and bustle of modern life and immerse yourself in the beauty and tranquility of the natural world</mark>. I’m also passionate about <mark>environmental conservation</mark>, and visiting the Amazon would allow me to witness firsthand the importance of protecting such a vital ecosystem. Additionally, I’d love to learn about the indigenous communities that live there and understand their way of life, as they have a deep connection to the forest.</p>
<p>Overall, the Amazon Rainforest represents both the beauty and fragility of our planet, and visiting it would be an unforgettable experience that combines adventure, learning, and a deeper appreciation for nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Why do people like visiting places with trees or forests?</strong>
People enjoy visiting places with trees or forests because these environments offer a sense of peace, relaxation, and connection to nature. Forests provide a break from the noise and stress of urban life, allowing visitors to unwind and recharge. The fresh air, natural beauty, and soothing sounds of rustling leaves or birdsong create a calming atmosphere. Additionally, forests often offer opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking, camping, or birdwatching, which promote physical health and mental well-being. For many, being surrounded by trees also evokes a sense of wonder and appreciation for the natural world.</p>

<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the discussion was about</p>
<p>What opinions you and your friend had</p>
<p>Why you think the discussion was interesting</p>
<p>And how you felt about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about a really interesting conversation I had with my best friend back in secondary school. It happened one afternoon while we were walking around the playground, just chatting and enjoying the fresh air. The topic we ended up discussing was “predicting the future,” which might sound a bit unusual, but it turned out to be a really <mark>thought-provoking</mark> conversation.</p>
<p>It all started when I casually mentioned that I felt like I could predict my own future, at least in the short term. What I meant was that I had a clear idea of what my day would look like—like my class schedule, when I’d have breaks, and what homework I needed to do. To me, that felt like predicting the future because I knew exactly what was coming next.</p>
<p>But my friend didn’t agree at all. She said that real prediction had to <mark>go beyond just knowing routines</mark>. To her, it meant understanding bigger things, like global events, relationships, or life-changing decisions. She thought true prediction required intuition and insight, not just logical thinking.</p>
<p>As we kept talking, I found her perspective really fascinating. She even <mark>brought up</mark>(提出) how scientists and philosophers might predict things based on data, but she believed there was more to it than just facts and research. Even though we had different views, we both realized that our ideas could be valid in their own way.</p>
<p>What made this discussion so interesting was that it made me think about time, destiny, and how much control we really have over our lives. We didn’t <mark>come to any conclusions</mark>, but it definitely sparked my curiosity about the future and how we understand it.</p>
<p>Even now, I still think about that conversation sometimes. It was one of the most thought-provoking discussions I’ve ever had, and it’s something I’ll always remember.</p>

<p><strong>1. When do children normally form their own views?</strong></p>
<p>Children begin forming their own views around the age of 3 or 4, but their opinions become more defined as they grow older, especially during adolescence. By around 10 to 12 years old, children <mark>develop a clearer sense of identity</mark> and are more capable of forming independent opinions on social or moral issues.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do children have strong opinions?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as children grow, especially <mark>during their teenage years</mark>, they often develop strong opinions on various topics like fairness, social issues, or politics. While their views might not always be fully informed, they can still be passionate and firm about them.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should parents request their kids to obey them?</strong></p>
<p>Parents should ask their children to obey rules for safety and discipline, but it's important to balance this with encouraging open communication. When children <mark>understand why rules are in place</mark>, they're more likely to respect them and develop a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>4. In what industries do you think communication is a necessary skill?</strong></p>
<p>Communication is crucial in many industries, particularly healthcare, education, customer service, and business. In each of these fields, clear communication ensures <mark>effective collaboration, problem-solving, and customer satisfaction, as well as smooth operation and safety.</mark></p>
<p><strong>5. Should parents consider their children's opinions on everything? Why?</strong></p>
<p>Parents should consider their children's opinions, especially as they grow older, to promote independence and mutual respect. However, some decisions, like those involving safety or well-being, may need to be made by parents. It's about finding a healthy balance between guidance and listening.</p>
<p><strong>6. Why do some young people refuse to communicate with others?</strong></p>
<p>Some young people avoid communication due to <mark>social anxiety, shyness,</mark> or past negative experiences like bullying. Others may feel misunderstood or simply <mark>prefer solitude</mark>, especially if they are introverted. A supportive environment can help them feel more comfortable opening up.</p>

<p>Describe a toy you liked in your childhood</p>
<p>You should say</p>
<p>What kind of toy it is</p>
<p>When you received it</p>
<p>How you played it</p>
<p>And how you felt about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One toy I absolutely loved as a child was a dragon doll. I can still remember how excited I was when I first got it, as I had always been fascinated by dragons ever since I was little. I think my love for dragons started from reading fairy tales and watching animated movies where these mythical creatures were portrayed as <strong>powerful and majestic beings</strong>. So, when I got the dragon doll, it felt like I finally had my own little piece of the fantasy world.</p>
<p>The dragon doll itself was quite special. It had a vibrant green color, with golden wings that shimmered when the light hit them. The body was <strong>soft and plush</strong>, but the wings and tail had a slightly stiffer texture, which made them stand out. It also had <mark>bright, sparkling eyes</mark> that gave it a very lifelike appearance, almost as though <mark>it could come to life at any moment</mark>. I used to spend hours playing with it, imagining all sorts of adventures where my dragon would fly through the skies and protect me from imaginary villains（坏人）.</p>
<p>What made this toy even more memorable for me was <strong>the sense of wonder and creativity it sparked</strong>. I didn't just play with it as a regular doll. I created entire worlds and stories around it, and it became a companion during many of my childhood games. It helped me develop my imagination and storytelling skills, as I would invent elaborate scenarios and scenarios involving my dragon. It also made me feel like I could escape into a fantasy realm whenever I wanted, which was something I really valued as a child.</p>
<p>Though I've grown up now and no longer play with the doll, I still <strong>keep it tucked away</strong> in a box as a reminder of my childhood and the magical adventures I had with it. It's not just a toy to me anymore; it's a symbol of the creativity and imagination that shaped a lot of my early years. It helped me dream big and created a sense of magic in my everyday life, which is something I will always treasure.</p>

<p><strong>1. How do advertisements influence children?</strong>
Advertisements influence children by <mark>shaping their preferences</mark>, desires, and even behaviors. For example, ads for toys, snacks, or games often <mark>use bright colors, catchy jingles, and popular characters to grab children's attention</mark>. This can lead to children pestering their parents to buy the advertised products. Additionally, advertisements can create unrealistic expectations or promote materialism, making children believe they need certain items to be happy or fit in with their peers. Over time, this can affect their values and spending habits as they grow older.</p>
<p><strong>2. Should advertising aimed at kids be prohibited?</strong>
I believe advertising aimed at kids should be <mark>regulated</mark>, if not entirely prohibited. Children are highly <mark>impressionable</mark> and may not have the critical thinking skills to understand the persuasive intent behind ads. This can lead to unhealthy consumption patterns, such as demanding sugary snacks or expensive toys. However, instead of a complete ban, stricter guidelines could be implemented to ensure ads promote positive messages, such as education or healthy habits. This way, children are protected without completely eliminating advertising.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do you think parents should buy more toys for their kids or spend more time with them?</strong>
I think spending more time with children is far more important than buying them toys. While toys can be entertaining and educational, they cannot replace the emotional connection and guidance that come from quality time with parents. Playing, talking, or engaging in activities together helps children <mark>develop social skills, confidence, and a sense of security</mark>. Toys might keep children occupied temporarily, but the memories and lessons from time spent with parents have a lasting impact on their development.</p>
<p><strong>4. What's the difference between the toys kids play now and those they played in the past?</strong>
The main difference between modern toys and those from the past is <mark>the level of technology and interactivity</mark>. Today's toys often include electronic components, such as lights, sounds, or apps, which make them more engaging but also more complex. In the past, toys were simpler and often made from natural materials like wood or fabric. They encouraged imaginative play and creativity, such as building blocks or dolls. While modern toys can be educational, they sometimes rely too much on pre-programmed features, leaving less room for creativity.</p>
<p><strong>5. What's the difference between the toys boys play with and girls play with?</strong>
Traditionally, toys for boys and girls have been divided along gender lines, with boys encouraged to play with <mark>action figures, cars, or construction sets</mark>, while girls are given <mark>dolls, kitchen sets, or dress-up kits</mark>. These differences often reflect societal stereotypes about gender roles. However, this trend is gradually changing as more parents and educators encourage children to play with a variety of toys, regardless of gender. This shift helps children develop a wider range of skills and interests, breaking away from outdated norms.</p>
<p><strong>6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of modern toys?</strong>
Modern toys have several advantages, such as being more interactive and educational. Many toys are designed to teach children coding, problem-solving, or other skills through games and activities. They also often feature advanced technology, like augmented reality, which can make learning fun and engaging. However, there are disadvantages too. Modern toys can be expensive and may require batteries or screens, which can limit imaginative play. Additionally, some toys may overstimulate children or discourage physical activity, leading to concerns about health and creativity.</p>

<p>I'd like to talk about an interesting neighbor of mine, Mrs. Li, who has been living next door for several years now. She's in her late seventies, but still very active and lively, which makes her stand out in the neighborhood. I first got to know her better when my family moved here, and we immediately became friends because of her <mark>warm and welcoming nature</mark>.</p>
<p>Mrs. Li is an incredibly fascinating person. Despite her age, she's traveled to more than 40 countries and has <mark>a wealth of stories to share</mark>. She's a retired professional travel writer, and over the years, she's written a number of books and articles about her adventures, which is something I find really impressive. What's even more amazing is how humble she is about it. Unlike many people who might brag about such accomplishments, Mrs. Li is very down-to-earth. She's always willing to listen to others and seems genuinely interested in hearing about what's going on in my life, too.</p>
<p>One of the things that really makes Mrs. Li stand out is her <strong>love of sharing her travel experiences</strong>. When we get the chance to chat, I can listen to her for hours. She's a fantastic storyteller, and I'm always captivated by the way she describes the different cultures, people, and places she's visited. She's not only well-traveled but also very knowledgeable, so when she speaks about her experiences, I always feel like I'm learning something new and valuable. I really admire her curiosity about the world and her open-minded approach to life.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we also <strong>share a lot of common interests</strong>. We both love painting, especially watercolor, and we often spend time together working on our paintings. I think it's great to have a neighbor who has similar hobbies, as it makes it easier to connect and share ideas. Additionally, Mrs. Li is very into yoga, and though I'm not as experienced as she is, she's always encouraging me to try new poses or attend local classes.</p>
<p>What I truly appreciate about Mrs. Li, though, is how non-pretentious she is. It's rare to meet someone with so much life experience who remains so humble and unassuming. She never makes conversations about herself, which is refreshing because sometimes people who have done a lot in life can become a bit arrogant or self-centered. But Mrs. Li is always interested in what I have to say and makes me feel heard.</p>
<p>In short, she's an inspiring, thoughtful, and kind person, and I feel really fortunate to have her as a neighbor. Our chats are something I look forward to, and I'm always learning from her, whether it's about life, travel, or art.</p>

<p>I'd like to talk about a <strong>technique</strong> that has really helped me stay focused during my studies, and that's using the <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong>. It might sound simple, but it has had a huge impact on my productivity. Essentially, this method involves breaking down my study time into <strong>25-minute intervals</strong>, known as 'Pomodoros', followed by a short 5-minute break. After four cycles, I take a longer break, usually around 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I discovered this technique a couple of years ago when I was struggling to stay concentrated while preparing for a major exam. I noticed that whenever I tried to study for long hours without breaks, my mind would start wandering, and I would become easily distracted. However, once I started using the Pomodoro Technique, it was like <strong>a game-changer</strong> for me. Knowing that I only have to focus for 25 minutes at a time makes the task seem more <strong>manageable</strong>, and the short breaks help me recharge mentally.</p>
<p>What I find particularly effective about this method is that it helps me maintain a <strong>high level of focus</strong> during those short bursts of time. I often turn off my phone and eliminate any distractions during each session. Surprisingly, I can accomplish much more in those concentrated intervals than when I try to study for hours on end without a clear structure. The breaks also prevent me from feeling burnt out, allowing me to sustain my energy levels throughout the day.</p>
<p>Besides, the Pomodoro Technique helps me <strong>stay motivated</strong> because <mark>it adds a sense of urgency</mark>. I try to challenge myself to complete a specific task before the timer runs out, which keeps me engaged. Additionally, after a few cycles, I reward myself with something small, like a cup of coffee or some snacks, which helps me stay refreshed and ready to continue.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this <mark>simple yet effective</mark> technique has greatly improved my ability to concentrate and manage my time efficiently. It's definitely something I would recommend to anyone struggling to stay focused, whether it's for studying or even working on other projects.</p>

<p>I’d like to talk about the Yangtze River, which is one of the most important rivers in my country, China. It’s located in the eastern part of the country, stretching over 6,300 kilometers from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in the west to the East China Sea in the east. It’s the longest river in Asia and the third-longest in the world, so its size alone makes it remarkable.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River is incredibly diverse in terms of its landscape. In the upper reaches, near its source, the river flows through steep mountains and deep valleys, creating breathtaking scenery. As it moves eastward, it passes through lush plains, bustling cities, and fertile farmlands. The river itself is wide and powerful, especially in the middle and lower sections, where it carries a huge volume of water. One of the most famous parts of the river is the Three Gorges, a stunning area with towering cliffs and dramatic views.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River is not just a natural wonder—it’s also a lifeline for millions of people. Historically and culturally, it has played a central role in Chinese civilization, often referred to as the “Mother River.” Many ancient cities and cultural sites are located along its banks, making it a symbol of China’s rich heritage.</p>
<p>Economically, the river is vital. It supports the livelihoods of people through agriculture, fishing, and transportation. The Yangtze River Basin is one of the most productive regions in China, contributing significantly to the country’s economy. Additionally, the river is home to the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest hydroelectric power station, which generates clean energy and helps control flooding.

This is why it’s often used in traditional Chinese music to <mark>evoke（引起） the beauty of nature</mark>. Listening to or playing the Gu Zheng brings me a sense of calm and relaxation. There’s something almost meditative about the flowing, melodic sounds it produces.</p>
<p>The Gu Zheng is deeply intertwined with Chinese culture and history. It’s often played during festivals and special occasions, and it can convey a wide range of emotions, from joy to sadness. For me, learning to play the Gu Zheng has been both challenging and rewarding. It requires a lot of precision and control, especially when using techniques like vibrato and glissando to express different moods. But the effort is worth it because it has helped me connect with my cultural heritage and develop a deeper appreciation for traditional Chinese music.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Gu Zheng is not just an instrument—it’s a bridge that connects the past with the present. It has enriched my life both musically and culturally, and I think it’s a beautiful representation of China’s artistic traditions.</p>

<p>And explain why you think it is interesting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to talk about a song called <strong>PPAP</strong>, which stands for <em>Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen</em>. It’s a super catchy and quirky song by a Japanese artist named <strong>Pikotaro</strong>, and it went viral back in 2016. What makes it so interesting is how simple and silly it is, but also how addictive it became.</p>
<p>The lyrics are basically just the words “pen,” “pineapple,” and “apple” repeated in different combinations, like “I have a pen, I have an apple, uh! Apple pen!” It doesn’t make much sense, but it’s so fun and easy to remember. The beat is really upbeat and energetic, and there’s a simple dance that goes with it, where you pretend to hold a pen and an apple. It’s so easy that people all over the world started copying it and sharing their own versions online.</p>
<p>What I find fascinating about this song is how it became <mark>a global phenomenon</mark>. It’s not a serious or deep song at all, but its humor and absurdity made it go viral on social media. It even appeared on TV shows and became a meme. For me, it’s a great example of how something simple and fun can capture everyone’s attention and bring people together.</p>
<p>In short, <strong>PPAP</strong> is a song that always makes me smile because of its silly charm and how it became such a big part of internet culture.</p>

<p>At first, people were a bit shy, but once the games started, everyone began laughing and interacting. The "Two Truths and a Lie" game was especially effective because it encouraged people to share interesting facts about themselves, sparking lively conversations.</p>
<p>Afterward, I received a lot of positive feedback. Many members said they felt more at ease and excited about future events. This made me proud because I had achieved my goal of creating a welcoming atmosphere.</p>

<p>Why you haven't achieved it</p>
<p>What you are doing about it now</p>
<p>And how you felt about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ambition that I haven't yet achieved is <strong>securing an internship</strong> during my last summer holiday. I had been really eager to gain some practical work experience before graduating, so I set a goal for myself to find an internship in my field of study. However, despite my best efforts, things didn't quite go as planned.</p>
<p>To prepare for this, I spent a significant amount of time <strong>polishing my CV</strong> and writing tailored cover letters. I wanted to make sure that my application stood out, so I highlighted my academic achievements, extracurricular activities, and any relevant skills I had acquired. Once I felt confident with my resume, I started sending it out to various companies, hoping to land a position that would align with my career goals.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite applying to numerous companies and positions, I faced a lot of <strong>rejections</strong>. Some companies didn't respond at all, while others sent polite but <strong>discouraging emails</strong>. It was quite disappointing, especially since I had invested so much time and effort into the application process. I even reached out to a few contacts and alumni for advice, but it still didn't work out.</p>
<p>One of the challenges I encountered was the fact that many companies preferred candidates with <strong>prior experience</strong>, which created a sort of paradox: I needed experience to get the internship, but I needed the internship to gain experience. This was definitely frustrating and made me question my own abilities at times.</p>
<p>Despite not achieving this goal, I've tried to look at the situation positively. I realized that setbacks like these are part of the journey and can be <strong>valuable learning experiences</strong>. I've learned to handle rejection better and have a clearer understanding of how competitive the job market can be. This experience has motivated me to <strong>enhance my skills</strong> even further, whether it's by taking online courses or participating in workshops, so that I can be better prepared for future opportunities.</p>
<p>I'm still determined to find an internship or some practical experience in my field before I graduate. I plan to <strong>start my search earlier</strong> next time, expand my network, and perhaps explore opportunities in smaller companies or startups where the competition might not be as fierce. I believe that if I stay persistent and continue to improve my skill set, I will eventually achieve this ambition.</p>

<p>So, my little cousin was only 8 or 9 years old at that time, and he just got a new puzzle for his birthday. It was a big one, probably 200 pieces. So, obviously, it was a bit of a challenge for him.
My uncle and his wife were cooking in the kitchen, and they left me and my cousin in the living room. In the beginning, the little boy was trying to show off（显摆） by putting the puzzle together all by himself. But very soon, he realized that it was a “mission impossible”（不可能的任务）.

In terms of how I helped him, basically, I helped him by teaching him the logic of doing a puzzle. I told him to always start from finding the corner pieces（四角的块块） and the edge pieces（四条边线上的块块）. That would set the stage（铺垫前景） and make things much easier（让事情变得简单）.

<p>I’d like to talk about Zhou Shen, a Chinese singer whom I follow on social media. Zhou Shen is widely known for his <mark>exceptional vocal range</mark> and his ability to sing in various styles, from pop to classical music.</p>
<p>I first discovered him a few years ago when I heard one of his songs featured in a popular TV drama called "The Voice of China." His voice immediately caught my attention – it has this <strong>ethereal</strong>（超凡的）, almost <strong>otherworldly</strong> quality. Since then, I’ve followed his updates on platforms like Weibo and NetEase Music.</p>
<p>What really attracts me to follow Zhou Shen on social media is <strong>his authenticity and his connection with fans</strong>. Despite his fame, he’s always been very humble and down-to-earth. His posts often <mark>feature</mark> behind-the-scenes glimpses of his life, from rehearsals to casual moments in his life. He shares his thoughts on music and life, and this personal touch makes him more <mark>relatable</mark>. I also admire how he interacts with his fans; for example, he often responds to comments and occasionally holds live-streaming sessions where he chats with his followers, which helps him build a closer relationship with his audience.</p>
<p>Apart from his music, Zhou Shen is also quite <strong>involved in charitable activities</strong>, and he uses his platform to raise awareness about important social issues. On his social media, he often posts about his involvement in fundraising campaigns, environmental causes, and other initiatives to help those in need. I really appreciate that he doesn’t just use his fame for personal gain, but also for the greater good, which makes me respect him even more.</p>
<p>Overall, Zhou Shen is not just <strong>a talented musician but also a positive and inspiring figure</strong> on social media. His genuine personality, his dedication to his craft, and his social responsibility are some of the reasons why I follow him closely.</p>

<p>And explain how you feel about the way/change</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One change that has significantly helped me save time and increase my productivity is using the Pomodoro Technique. This is a <mark>time-management method</mark> that involves working in focused bursts of 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four ‘Pomodoros' , you take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. I first came across the Pomodoro Technique during university when I was struggling to balance studying with other commitments.</p>
<p>Before I started using it, I would often <strong>find myself procrastinating or working inefficiently</strong> for long hours without getting much done. The Pomodoro Technique has completely transformed the way I approach tasks. It breaks down the work into manageable chunks, so I never <mark>feel overwhelmed</mark>, and the short breaks allow me to recharge before diving back into the task.</p>
<p>One of the major advantages is that it helps me stay <strong>highly focused</strong>. Knowing that I only need to work for a short, set period means that I'm less likely to get distracted or lose motivation. I find that I'm able to maintain a higher level of concentration compared to when I try to work for several hours straight. Over time, I've found that I'm able to complete tasks much faster, without compromising the quality of my work.</p>
<p>In addition, the Pomodoro Technique also encourages me to be more mindful about how I use my time. Because I have these short breaks, I've become more <mark>conscious of</mark> my productivity patterns and can <mark>adjust my workflow</mark> if I feel I'm not being as efficient as I could be. Overall, adopting the Pomodoro Technique has saved me a lot of time by helping me <strong>work more effectively, stay organized, and reduce burnout</strong>.

<p>One of the most <strong>memorable events</strong> I celebrated recently was <strong>New Year's Eve on December 31<sup>st</sup>, 2023</strong>, which coincided with an annual celebration called <strong>Student's Day</strong> on our university campus. This event is something I look forward to every year because it's a unique combination of welcoming the new year and celebrating the vibrancy of student life.</p>
<p>The celebration is truly <strong>a full-day affair, packed with a variety of activities</strong>. The day began with a <strong>student parade</strong> in the morning. It was incredible to watch the students marching in colorful costumes, holding banners, and showcasing different performances representing various clubs and departments. The parade had a lively and festive atmosphere, and you could feel the energy and excitement in the air. Everyone was cheering, taking photos, and soaking in the festive spirit.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the campus was <strong>bustling with small games and competitions</strong> organized by different student organizations. I participated in a few games with my friends, like tug-of-war and a trivia quiz, which was a lot of fun. These activities brought everyone together, and it was a great way to bond with classmates and even make new friends. I especially enjoyed the friendly, competitive spirit that filled the air.</p>
<p>However, the <strong>highlight</strong> of the day was definitely the <strong>party performances</strong> held on the playground in the evening. As night fell, the entire campus was lit up with fairy lights and decorations, creating a magical ambiance. There were performances by student bands, dance groups, and even some comedy sketches, which had everyone laughing and clapping. Additionally, there was a campfire activity where all the students gathered around the flames, dancing and enjoying each other's company under the night sky.</p>
<p>What made this event so special was not just the celebration itself but also the feeling of <strong>togetherness</strong>. It was the perfect way to wrap up the year and welcome a new one surrounded by friends, laughter, and a sense of community. I felt genuinely happy and grateful to be a part of such a lively and positive environment.</p>
<p>This celebration will always hold a special place in my heart because it reminded me of the joy of being in college, surrounded by people who are not just classmates but a second family. It was a day full of <strong>fun, excitement, and unforgettable memories</strong>.</p>

<p>Today, I'd like to talk about an invention that has become incredibly useful in my life: <strong>online payment systems</strong>. This technology has really transformed how I <mark>handle my finances and go about my daily activities</mark>. It includes various platforms like mobile banking apps, digital wallets, and payment systems like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and others.
I first started using online payments a few years ago, and it's made my life so much easier and more efficient. In the past, whenever I needed to pay bills or make purchases, I had to visit physical stores or banks, which was <mark>time-consuming</mark>, especially with long queues. Now, I can pay for almost anything with just a few taps on my phone. Whether it's paying for groceries, ordering food delivery, or booking a taxi, I can do it instantly without needing cash or even a physical card. Also, these systems are <mark>highly secure, with encryption and two-factor authentication</mark>, so I don't worry much about fraud.
Another thing I appreciate about online payments is how they make traveling simpler. I don't have to carry large amounts of cash when I'm in a foreign country. I can just use my phone to pay for things, which is really helpful and <mark>reduces the hassle of currency exchange</mark>.
Overall, I would say online payments have made my life more convenient, efficient, and secure. It's hard to imagine going back to the old days when I had to withdraw cash from ATMs or write checks. This invention has definitely become an indispensable part of my everyday life, and I believe it's something that more people will continue to rely on in the future.</p>

<p><strong>1. What qualities do inventors have?</strong>
Inventors typically possess qualities like creativity, curiosity, and perseverance. They are able to <mark>think outside the box</mark> and come up with innovative solutions to problems. Curiosity drives them to explore new ideas and ask questions that others might overlook. Additionally, perseverance is crucial because the invention process often involves trial and error, failures, and setbacks. Inventors also need strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently or collaboratively, depending on the project.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do all inventions bring benefits to our world?</strong>
Not all inventions bring benefits; some can have negative consequences or unintended side effects. For example, while inventions like <mark>plastic</mark> have revolutionized industries, they have also led to environmental pollution. Similarly, advancements in technology, such as social media, have connected people globally but have also contributed to issues like misinformation and mental health problems. It’s important to evaluate the long-term impact of inventions to ensure they contribute positively to society.</p>
<p><strong>3. Who should support and sponsor inventors, governments or private companies?</strong>
Both governments and private companies have roles to play in supporting inventors. Governments can provide <mark>funding, grants, and policies</mark> that encourage innovation, especially in areas that may <mark>not be immediately profitable but are socially beneficial</mark>, such as healthcare or environmental sustainability. Private companies, on the other hand, can offer <mark>resources, expertise, and market access</mark> to bring inventions to life. A collaborative approach, where both sectors work together, can create an environment that fosters innovation and ensures its benefits are widely shared.</p>
<p><strong>4. What inventions do you think should be improved?</strong>
An area for improvement is plastic materials. While plastic is versatile and durable, its non-biodegradable nature has led to environmental crises. Developing eco-friendly alternatives or better recycling methods is essential.</p>
<p><strong>5. Do you think only scientists can invent new things?</strong>
No, I don’t think only scientists can invent new things. While scientists often play a key role in technological and medical advancements, <mark>inventors come from all walks of life</mark>. For example, entrepreneurs, engineers, artists, and even everyday individuals can come up with innovative ideas or solutions to problems. Many inventions arise from practical needs or creative thinking rather than formal scientific research. Collaboration across different fields and perspectives often leads to the most <mark>groundbreaking innovations</mark>.</p>
<p><strong>6. Are there any other inventions that make the world better?</strong>
Yes, there are countless inventions that have made the world better. For instance, the internet has revolutionized communication, education, and access to information, connecting people across the globe. Medical inventions like vaccines and antibiotics have saved millions of lives and improved public health. Renewable energy technologies, such as solar panels and wind turbines, are helping to combat climate change by providing cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels. These inventions demonstrate how creativity and innovation can address global challenges and improve quality of life.</p>

<p>You should say:</p>
<p>When it happened</p>
<p>Where you were</p>
<p>What you did</p>
<p>And explain why you were busy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to talk about a time when I was extremely busy, which happened during <mark>the exams week</mark> in college last semester. It was one of the most <strong>stressful periods</strong> I've ever experienced because I had to prepare for nine exams, and I only had a week to do it. To be honest, I got myself into that situation because I had <mark>procrastinated on my review schedule</mark> and left everything until the last minute.</p>
<p>At the start of that week, I realized how much I needed to <mark>catch up on</mark>. Each subject required intensive preparation, and the topics were quite challenging. I was <mark>overwhelmed</mark>, but there was no time to waste, so I quickly created a strict study plan. I divided my time into blocks, dedicating several hours each day to each subject, and even sacrificed sleep to make more time for studying. There were days when I was up until 3 or 4 in the morning, only to wake up a few hours later and continue revising.</p>
<p>To make things even more stressful, all the exams were <strong>back-to-back with no breaks in between</strong>. I remember one particular day when I had two exams, one in the morning and another in the afternoon. As soon as I finished the first exam, I rushed to the library to cram for the next one. I had to juggle multiple textbooks, class notes, and online resources, trying to digest as much information as possible in a short time.</p>
<p>What made it even more difficult was that <strong>each subject required a different approach</strong>. For subjects like mathematics and physics, I had to focus on solving practice problems, while for literature and politics, I had to memorize facts and analyze texts. I was mentally exhausted, but I kept <mark>pushing through</mark> because I knew I didn't have any other option.</p>
<p>In the end, it was an exhausting week, but it paid off. I managed to <mark>get through</mark> all nine exams, and although I didn't get perfect scores, I was able to pass them all with decent grades. The experience taught me a valuable lesson about <strong>time management</strong> and the importance of starting my preparation early. I realized that the stress and sleepless nights could have been avoided if I had been more disciplined with my study schedule from the beginning.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Are you often busy? </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. What are the advantages and disadvantages when people keep busy?</strong>
Keeping busy has several advantages, such as increasing productivity, reducing boredom, and providing a sense of purpose. When people are occupied with meaningful tasks, they often feel more accomplished and motivated. However, there are also disadvantages. Being too busy can lead to stress, burnout, and a lack of work-life balance. It may also leave little time for relaxation, self-care, or spending time with loved ones. Therefore, it’s important to find a balance between staying busy and allowing time for rest.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do you think children should learn through playing games or under pressure?</strong>
I believe children learn best through playing games rather than under pressure. Games make learning fun and engaging, which helps children retain information and develop skills like problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork. For example, educational games can teach math, language, or science concepts in an interactive way. On the other hand, learning under pressure can lead to anxiety, fear of failure, and a negative attitude toward education. A balanced approach, where play is combined with gentle guidance, is ideal for fostering a love of learning.</p>
<p><strong>3. What kind of pressure do people may experience at work?</strong>
People may experience various types of pressure at work, such as meeting tight deadlines, handling heavy workloads, or dealing with high expectations from supervisors. They might also face pressure to perform well, compete with colleagues, or adapt to changes in the workplace. Additionally, interpersonal conflicts or a lack of work-life balance can contribute to stress. These pressures can affect mental and physical health, making it important for employers to create a supportive and manageable work environment.</p>
<p><strong>4. How does technology help with time management?</strong>
Technology helps with time management by providing tools and apps that organize tasks, set reminders, and track progress. For example, calendar apps allow users to schedule appointments and prioritize activities, while project management software helps teams collaborate and meet deadlines efficiently. Additionally, automation tools can handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for more important activities. Technology also enables remote work, reducing time spent commuting and allowing for more flexible schedules. Overall, it enhances productivity and helps people make the most of their time.</p>
<p><strong>5. Does technology distract people?</strong>
Yes, technology can be a significant source of distraction. For instance, social media, entertainment apps, and notifications often interrupt focus and reduce productivity. Many people find it challenging to resist the temptation to check their phones or browse the internet, especially when working or studying. However, technology can also be used to minimize distractions through features like “do not disturb” modes or apps that block access to distracting sites. The key is to use technology mindfully and set boundaries to stay focused.</p>

<p>One of the most surprising and happiest moments I've experienced was when I received a <strong>birthday cake from my boyfriend</strong> at the time. This happened about two years ago, and I still remember it vividly because it was such an unexpected yet touching gesture.</p>
<p>To give you some context, my boyfriend and I were in a <strong>long-distance relationship</strong> back then. My birthday was approaching, and honestly, I wasn't expecting much since we couldn't be together in person. I had planned to just spend the day quietly with a few close friends. However, on the morning of my birthday, I received a delivery, and to my absolute surprise, there was a <strong>beautifully decorated cake</strong> waiting for me.</p>
<p>What made this surprise so special was the effort he put into it. It wasn't just any store-bought cake—it was <strong>handcrafted and customized</strong> with my favorite flavors and decorations.

<p>Sadly, we eventually <strong>broke up</strong> due to the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship. However, looking back, that surprise is still one of the <strong>fondest memories</strong> I have. It not only made me happy but also reminded me that even small gestures can have a significant impact on someone's emotions.</p>

<p>I'd like to talk about my friend Anna, who I absolutely love talking to. We've known each other for about 3 years now, ever since we met in university, and over time, she's become one of the people I cherish the most in my life. Whenever I need someone to talk to, whether it's about <mark>something serious or just a lighthearted chat</mark>, Anna is always my <mark>go-to person</mark>.
One of the main reasons I enjoy talking to her is because she's such an attentive listener. No matter what I'm talking about, she always gives me her full attention, which is quite rare these days when people are often distracted by their phones. She doesn't just listen passively either—she <mark>asks thoughtful questions and offers insightful advice</mark>. For example, there was a time when I was really struggling with making an academic decision, and she helped me weigh the pros and cons without being pushy or judgmental. Her ability to understand my perspective and give me advice that's actually helpful is something I truly appreciate.
Another reason I love our conversations is because we share similar interests, especially when it comes to books, movies, and current events. We often end up having deep discussions about the latest book we've read or a thought-provoking documentary we've watched. These conversations can sometimes last for hours, but it never feels like a waste of time because I always come away feeling inspired or having learned something new.
What I admire most about Anna is her sense of humor. Even when we're talking about serious topics, she has this amazing ability to make me laugh. It's not that she makes light of serious matters, but rather, she knows how to <mark>add a touch of humor that lightens the mood</mark>. This is especially comforting when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed—she just has a way of turning my day around with her jokes and witty comments.
All in all, talking to Anna is something I genuinely look forward to because it's not only enjoyable but also meaningful. I always feel understood, supported, and uplifted after our conversations. It's a rare thing to have someone in your life with whom you can talk about almost anything, and I consider myself lucky to have a friend like her.</p>

<p>I'd like to talk about Sun Yingsha, who is one of the most well-known athletes in China today. She's a phenomenal table tennis player, and she's gained <mark>widespread recognition</mark>, especially after her impressive performance in the 2024 Paris Olympics. Sun Yingsha has become a household name in China, not just because of her <mark>exceptional skills</mark>, but also because of her <mark>dedication, sportsmanship, and relentless pursuit of excellence</mark>.
At the Paris Olympics, Sun Yingsha had a remarkable run. She won several medals, among which the mixed doubles gold was particularly significant because it was the first-ever mixed doubles gold medal for the Chinese table tennis team. 
What really impresses me about Sun Yingsha is her determination and focus on the game.(She's known for her incredible agility, quick reflexes, and powerful shots.) Watching her play is truly inspiring because she always gives it her all, whether it's a national competition or the Olympic finals. Despite being under immense pressure, she maintains a calm demeanor, which is something I really admire.
Beyond her skills on the table, Sun Yingsha is also admired for her humility. Despite her numerous achievements, she remains <mark>grounded</mark> and always credits her teammates and coaches for her success. This attitude has won her a lot of fans, not just in China but around the world. 
Her popularity in China goes beyond just sports enthusiasts. She has become a symbol of <mark>perseverance and excellence</mark>, especially for the younger generation. Many young athletes look up to her as a role model because she shows that with hard work, anything is possible. 
All in all, Sun Yingsha is a true sports icon in China. I believe she will continue to inspire future generations with her incredible talent and unwavering dedication to the sport.</p>

Currently, she works as a graphic designer for a well-known agency, and I've always been fascinated by her work.
The reason I would like to work with her is that we both share a passion for creative projects. I have some skills in building website and content creation, so I think we would <mark>complement</mark> each other quite well if we started a business together. For instance, I imagine we could run a small design and marketing firm, where she could handle the visual elements, while I focus on managing social media, and marketing strategies. It's something we've casually discussed a few times, and I believe our combined skills would make for a solid partnership.
Moreover, my cousin is someone who is extremely <mark>disciplined and has a strong work ethic</mark>, which I think would be a great influence on me. She's always been the kind of person who plans things <mark>meticulously</mark>, whether it's a project deadline or even a family event. This kind of structured approach to work is something I could definitely learn from. On the other hand, I'm a bit more spontaneous and flexible, so I think we would balance each other out quite well.
Another reason I'd love to collaborate with her is that working with a family member, especially someone I'm close to, would make the experience more enjoyable. I imagine it would create <strong>a sense of trust and openness</strong>, which can be hard to find when working with colleagues you don't know as well. Of course, there could be challenges, such as mixing family and business, but I think our strong communication skills would help us overcome any potential conflicts.
If the opportunity arises in the future, I would love to <mark>start a creative venture with my cousin</mark>. It excites me, and I believe it would not only strengthen our relationship but also help both of us grow professionally.</p>

<p>Describe a long walk you ever had</p>
<p>You should say</p>
<p>When this happened</p>
<p>Where you walked</p>
<p>Who you were with</p>
<p>And explain how you feel about this long walk</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The longest walk I've ever had was during my senior high school <strong>military training</strong>, which was <strong>an intense and memorable experience</strong>. It was part of a mandatory program designed to build endurance, discipline, and teamwork among students. The walk was about 10 kilometers, and we had to <strong>march</strong> from our school to an outdoor tourist attraction called the <strong>Oriental Oasis</strong>, which is a well-known park and scenic area.</p>
<p>The walk itself was part of a larger training activity, so we had to follow a strict schedule and walk in formation with a large group of fellow students. I remember the morning we set off – it was very early, and the air was cool and fresh. At first, it seemed manageable. But later, as we walked further from the school and into the countryside, the distance started to feel longer and the landscape began to change.</p>
<p>The route wasn't particularly difficult, but <strong>the challenge was maintaining a steady pace</strong>. Such a long walk was very demanding physically, and after a while, my legs started to feel sore. However, there was <mark>a sense of camaraderie</mark> among my classmates, and we encouraged each other to keep going. We would sing songs or share jokes from time to time to distract ourselves from the exhaustion, and that definitely helped <mark>keep our spirits up</mark>.</p>
<p>When we finally reached the <strong>Oriental Oasis</strong>, it felt like a huge accomplishment. No one straggled. The sense of relief was overwhelming, and we were able to relax and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. </p>
<p>In retrospect, that 10-kilometer walk was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life. It taught me a lot about physical endurance, teamwork, and the importance of perseverance. Even though it was tough at times, I'm glad I had the chance to do it, as it not only <mark>built my stamina</mark> but also gave me a sense of achievement that I still carry with me today.</p>

<p>One thing I absolutely can’t live without is my <strong>notebook</strong>. It’s not just a place to <mark>jot down my thoughts</mark>; it’s a tool for organizing my life, processing emotions, and even setting goals.</p>
<p>I use my notebook for a variety of purposes. One of the most important things I do with it is to have conversations with myself. I write down my thoughts, reflect on my day, and track my progress over time. This practice feels like a form of self-therapy, as it helps me process my emotions and gain clarity about my feelings. For example, when I’m feeling overwhelmed, writing everything down helps me break things into smaller, manageable steps, which instantly reduces my stress.</p>
<p>In addition to its emotional benefits, my notebook is <mark>invaluable</mark> for its practicality. I use it to brainstorm new ideas, draft plans for upcoming events, or list things I need to accomplish. The physical act of writing helps me transform vague thoughts into concrete actions, which is something I find much more satisfying than typing on a phone or computer. While apps can be convenient, they don’t give me the same <mark>sense of connection and focus</mark> that writing on paper does.</p>
<p>What makes my notebook so essential is that it’s more than just a tool—it’s a companion that helps me <mark>stay grounded, creative, and reflective</mark>. It’s a space where I can be completely honest with myself, whether I’m setting goals, working through challenges, or simply capturing moments of inspiration. Without it, I’d feel disorganized and disconnected from my own thoughts.</p>
<p>In short, my notebook is something I can’t live without because it plays such a central role in both my emotional well-being and my daily productivity. It’s a simple yet powerful tool that helps me navigate life with clarity and purpose.</p>

<p>How it helped you learn the language</p>
<p>And how you felt about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One effective thing I did to learn English was to immerse myself in the language by <strong>watching movies and TV shows in English</strong>. I started doing this a few years ago, as I felt that my reading and writing skills were improving, but my listening and speaking abilities were still not at the level I wanted.</p>
<p>At first, I watched with subtitles in Chinese to understand the context and storyline, but gradually, I switched to English subtitles. This helped me <mark>connect the spoken words with their written form</mark>, and it also allowed me to learn new vocabulary and expressions. The great thing about watching movies and TV shows is that they expose you to various accents and colloquial（口语的） language, which is often not covered in traditional language lessons.</p>
<p>I chose to watch <strong>a variety of genres</strong>, from dramas to comedies, and even documentaries. I wanted to get used to different tones, speeds of speaking, and formal versus informal language. For example, I watched 2 Broke Girls. They use everyday, conversational English, which helped me sound more natural in casual conversations. Additionally, watching documentaries or news programs helped me improve my formal language and understanding of more complex vocabulary.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this approach was that it made learning English more <strong>enjoyable</strong>. Instead of seeing it as a task, I started to look forward to the next episode or movie, and without realizing it, I was learning new phrases and improving my listening skills. It also gave me <strong>a better understanding of culture</strong> and the way people interact in different contexts, which I think is crucial for mastering any language.</p>
<p>Overall, watching TV shows and movies in English was a fun and effective way for me to enhance my language skills. It allowed me to practice listening, pick up new words, and become more familiar with English-speaking cultures, all while keeping my learning process engaging.</p>

<p>One item of clothing that I received as a gift and have cherished for years is a handmade sweater from my grandma. She gave it to me as a birthday present several years ago, and it <mark>holds a lot of sentimental value</mark> for me.</p>
<p>The sweater is really special not just because it's a gift from my grandma, but also because she made it herself. My grandma <strong>has been knitting for</strong> as long as I can remember, and she's always crafted beautiful, intricate pieces for her family. When I opened the package and saw the sweater, I was immediately <strong>struck by the craftsmanship</strong>. It's made of soft wool, and the pattern is quite unique – a combination of subtle colors and geometric shapes that give it a cozy yet stylish look. The fit was perfect at the time, and it was incredibly comfortable to wear.</p>
<p>What makes this sweater even more meaningful is the thought and time my grandma put into making it. She spent weeks working on it, knitting each section carefully, and I know that she <mark>poured a lot of love and attention into every stitch</mark>. Every time I wore it, I felt a deep connection to her and a sense of warmth, both physically and emotionally.</p>
<p>However, now that I've grown up, I've outgrown the sweater. It no longer fits me as it once did, which is a bit <mark>bittersweet</mark>. Still, I can't bring myself to part with it because it holds so many memories. Even though I can't wear it anymore, I keep it <mark>tucked away</mark> in my wardrobe as a reminder of my grandma's affection and the special bond we share. Sometimes, when I'm feeling nostalgic, I take it out just to feel close to her.</p>
<p>Overall, this handmade sweater is one of the most meaningful gifts I've ever received. It's not just about the sweater itself, but the love, effort, and thought behind it. That's why it will always hold a special place in my heart, even if I can no longer wear it.</p>

We had been together for about three years, and during that period of time, I was <mark>in two minds</mark>（犹豫，纠结） all the time. <em>On one hand</em>, he was funny and charming.

He really put a lot of pressure on me. I mean, I'm an independent person with an independent mind, so I couldn't just blindly follow his commands（跟随他的指令）. He was very bossy（霸道的） and macho（大男子主义的）.
I <strong>was torn between</strong>（很纠结） leaving and staying. I didn't want to rush into the decision（匆忙做决定）, so I waited long enough because I wanted to give it a chance. After being together for three years, I was very unhappy, so I finally made up my mind（彻底下决定） to leave him. I told him about my decision. It wasn't easy for me. I was crying and having a meltdown when I saw him for the last time. And he refused to take it. We were not <strong>on the same page</strong> at all（意见不一致，他不想分手）.
After the breakup, in the beginning, he was still trying to influence my decision by constantly calling me and trying to see me. It was extremely difficult for me to not pick up the phone. But I <mark>pulled myself together</mark>（振作起来）. I didn't give him any chances to talk to me. And eventually, after 6 months, he gave up.
I'm now feeling so much better without him. Everything is water under the bridge（事情都过去了）. Even though I still miss him sometimes, I know it will all be over one day. Time will heal everything（时间会治愈一切）. It was a tough decision to make, but it was the right thing to do.</p>

She explained that she felt suffocated in the relationship because he expected her to follow his commands, which didn't align with her independent nature. I could see how this was affecting her mental and emotional well-being. She was hesitant about making a decision because they had been together for so long, and she felt that ending things might be too drastic. But at the same time, she was unhappy and didn't feel like she could truly be herself around him.</p>
<p>After listening to her, I told her that if the relationship was making her miserable, it was probably better for her to walk away. I reminded her that staying in a relationship out of fear of being alone is never a good reason. She needed to prioritize her own happiness and mental health. Although it was a tough suggestion to make, I believed it was the right call.</p>
<p>In the end, she decided to take my advice and broke up with him. The breakup was really hard on her at first because her ex-boyfriend kept trying to reach out, calling her and asking to meet. I remember she had a hard time resisting the urge to answer his calls, but she stayed strong and eventually <mark>cut off all communication</mark>. After several months, he finally stopped contacting her, and she began to heal.</p>
<p>Now, she often tells me how grateful she is for my advice. She feels much lighter and happier without the constant stress he brought into her life. While it wasn't easy for her to go through, she now realizes it was the right thing to do. Seeing her in a much better place now confirms that sometimes, giving difficult advice is necessary, even if it's hard for someone to hear.</p>

<p>Describe a time when you were stuck in a traffic jam</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>When it happened</p>
<p>Where you were stuck</p>
<p>What you did while waiting</p>
<p>And explain how you felt in the traffic jam</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to talk about a time when I was stuck in a traffic jam, but it wasn't the typical car traffic you might imagine. This happened on my university campus, and it involved bikes rather than cars. Since I'm a student, I commute to different classes on my electric bike every day because our campus is quite large. There's a long break between classes, and during this time, many students, including myself, need to move between buildings. Unfortunately, this often leads to a chaotic situation.</p>
<p>The main issue is that there's only one main road connecting the east and west sides of the campus, and it's the shortest route. Taking any other path would be three times longer, so naturally, everyone prefers using this route. One day, I had a class in a building on the west side, and I had just finished a class in the east. The teacher delayed the class for 5 minutes, so as soon as the class was over, I jumped on my bike and headed towards the other building.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I reached the main road, I found myself stuck in a bike traffic jam. There were dozens, if not hundreds, of students on electric bikes, all trying to use the same road at the same time. The university guard was trying to manage the flow, but many students were impatient and didn't listen to his instructions. This only made the situation worse, as everyone was trying to squeeze through, making the road even more <mark>congested</mark>.</p>
<p>I was frustrated because I knew I was running late. At one point, we were all <strong>at a standstill</strong>, unable to move forward or backward. When the traffic finally started moving again, I still had to struggle to find a parking spot near my class building. Most of the parking spaces were already full, so I ended up circling around, wasting even more time. In the end, I arrived five minutes late for my class, which was quite embarrassing.</p>
<p>Looking back, it was a stressful experience, but it also taught me to plan my commute better during those peak times. Now, if I know I have back-to-back classes in different buildings, I try to leave a bit earlier to avoid getting stuck in that bike traffic jam. It's definitely one of those unique challenges of being a student on a large campus.</p>

<p>What the contest/competition is about</p>
<p>Where the contest/competition will take place</p>
<p>When it will be held</p>
<p>And explain why you would like to participate in it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One competition I would really like to participate in is the <strong>bicycle slow-riding contest</strong> held at my school. This competition is quite unique because it challenges participants to ride their bicycles as slowly as possible without losing balance or touching the ground. I first got interested in this competition when my roommate participated in it last year and ended up winning first place. I was really impressed by how skillfully she managed to maintain her balance while riding at such a slow pace, and it inspired me to give it a try myself.</p>
<p>What makes this competition so <strong>intriguing</strong> to me is that it's <mark>not about speed or endurance, but rather about balance, control, and patience</mark>. The riders are required to pedal slowly and steadily, and if you stop or put your feet on the ground, you're <strong>disqualified</strong>. It's a real test of your ability to stay focused and maintain steady control of the bike, which I think is a fun and challenging way to compete.</p>
<p>I believe I would be able to do well in this competition because I have a good sense of balance. I've been riding bicycles since I was quite young, and over the years, I've developed a pretty solid skill set for balancing and controlling my bike in different situations.</p>
<p>One of the things I like most about this competition is that it's accessible to everyone on campus. I'm excited about the idea of participating because it would be a great way to test my limits, improve my concentration, and also have a bit of fun with my friends. I'd definitely be proud to take part in such a competition and maybe even bring home a trophy like my roommate did.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most surprising and happiest moments I've experienced was when I received a <strong>birthday cake from my boyfriend</strong> at the time. This happened about two years ago, and I still remember it vividly because it was such an unexpected yet touching gesture.</p>
<p>To give you some context, my boyfriend and I were in a <strong>long-distance relationship</strong> back then. My birthday was approaching, and honestly, I wasn't expecting much since we couldn't be together in person. I had planned to just spend the day quietly with a few close friends. However, on the morning of my birthday, I received a delivery, and to my absolute surprise, there was a <strong>beautifully decorated cake</strong> waiting for me.</p>
<p>What made this surprise so special was the effort he put into it. It wasn't just any store-bought cake—it was <strong>handcrafted and customized</strong> with my favorite flavors and decorations. Apparently, he had <strong>coordinated with</strong> a local bakery near my school. The cake had a small note attached, expressing how much he missed me and wished he could be there to celebrate with me in person.</p>
<p>Receiving that cake was incredibly <mark>heartwarming and truly made my day</mark>. At that moment, I felt a surge of <strong>happiness and appreciation</strong> because I realized just how much he cared. It <strong>wasn't</strong> just the cake itself <strong>but</strong> the thoughtfulness behind the gesture that made it so memorable. To be honest, I was almost moved to tears because it was the last thing I was expecting.</p>
<p>Sadly, we eventually <strong>broke up</strong> due to the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship. However, looking back, that surprise is still one of the <strong>fondest memories</strong> I have. It not only made me happy but also reminded me that even small gestures can have a significant impact on someone's emotions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to talk about a time when I received some very helpful advice regarding my studies during high school. Back then, I was under a lot of pressure to perform well academically, and I often found myself feeling overwhelmed and distracted whenever I tried to study. So, I decided to visit the school's <mark>counseling office to seek some guidance</mark>.</p>
<p>When I explained my situation to the counselor, I told her that my biggest struggle was <mark>maintaining concentration</mark>. I would often start studying with good intentions, but within minutes, my mind would <mark>wander off</mark>, and I'd end up procrastinating or getting distracted by my phone. That's when she suggested a technique called the Pomodoro Technique, which was something I had never heard of before.</p>
<p>The Pomodoro Technique involves breaking your study time into 25-minute intervals, called "pomodoros," followed by a short 5-minute break. After completing four of these intervals, you can take a longer break of about 15 to 30 minutes. The counselor explained that this method helps improve focus and productivity by giving the brain regular breaks, which <mark>prevents burnout and keeps you refreshed</mark>. She advised me to try it out, especially since I was struggling with staying on task for long periods.</p>
<p>I decided to follow her advice, and to my surprise, it made a significant difference. I started using a timer on my phone to break my study sessions into 25-minute chunks, and I noticed that my concentration improved dramatically. Knowing that a break was coming made it easier to stay focused during each interval. I also felt less stressed because instead of trying to force myself to study for hours on end, I was <mark>working in manageable bursts</mark>. It made my study sessions much more efficient and even enjoyable.</p>
<p>What I appreciated most about this advice was that it was <strong>practical and easy to implement</strong>, yet it had <mark>a profound impact on my productivity</mark>. This simple technique helped me manage my study stress better and made a noticeable difference in my performance. To this day, I still use the Pomodoro Technique whenever I need to focus on a challenging task, and I'm grateful to that counselor for introducing me to it.</p>
<p>Overall, this experience taught me that sometimes, the right advice can completely change the way you approach your studies. The Pomodoro Technique was a <mark>game-changer</mark> for me, and it's something that continues to benefit me even now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Normally I'm not a <strong>scatterbrain</strong>（马虎健忘之人）. I don't lose things easily. I'm always double checking（反复确认） my stuff before I leave a place, super mindful. That's why I remember this experience so well, that was one of the only few times that I lost my stuff.</p>
<p>It was my dear iPad. Last year, I took the train back home. And in order to kill the time on my way, I took out my iPad. In the beginning, I was watching a movie. And then, I started feeling very sleepy and wanted to take a nap（打个盹）.</p>
<p>I felt lazy（犯懒） to put the iPad back into my suitcase, as I knew later, I would use it again after the nap. So, I put the iPad in the pocket in front of me. You know, there's always a thin pocket behind the seat in front of you（你前面座位的后方的薄薄的口袋）? So, yeh, I put it there. The pocket was not big, so I could still see the tip of my ipad（平板电脑的上方一角）. I thought that would remind me that there was my ipad in the pocket. But NO! I completely forgot my iPad after the nap. Like it was never there. I just removed the memory out of my brain（从记忆力删除了这个信息）. </p>
<p>After I got off the train, several hours passed by, and suddenly <strong>I jumped out of my skin</strong>（跳出我的皮肤，吓得灵魂出窍）. “Where is my iPad?! ”And that was when I remembered it was still on the train!! I called the lost and found office（失物招领办公室） at the train station, told them about my tragedy（悲剧）. The customer service representative（客服代表）comforted me（安抚了我）, and helped me call the head of  the conductor of the train（一个意思，车长）, anyway, he said he would search it for me.
Several hours later, I got a phone call from him and was told that he found the iPad. I felt so lucky and grateful to get my baby back. And at the same time, I felt very guilty for being so <mark>unmindful</mark>. I hate troubling people（我讨厌麻烦别人）. So, yeh, that was the story. </p>

<p>And explain why it can help you keep fit and healthy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One activity I regularly do to stay fit is <strong>following an online streamer for exercise routines</strong>. I started this habit around a year ago when I realized I needed to <mark>improve my fitness level</mark> but didn't have the motivation to go to a gym or fitness class. The convenience of exercising at home with the guidance of a live streamer was a <mark>game-changer</mark> for me.</p>
<p>The streamer I follow specializes in <strong>HIIT workouts</strong>, which stand for <strong>High-Intensity Interval Training</strong>. These sessions typically last about 30 to 45 minutes and combine cardio exercises with strength training, which helps me not only burn calories but also build muscle. What I find particularly motivating is that the streamer often <strong>interacts with viewers</strong>, offering words of encouragement and answering questions in real-time. This interactive aspect makes the experience much more <mark>engaging</mark> than simply following a pre-recorded video.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I enjoy exercising this way is that it <mark>fits easily into my schedule</mark>. I can join the live stream whenever it's convenient for me, and if I miss a session, I can always watch the recording later. Plus, the <strong>variety of workouts</strong> keeps things interesting. The streamer mixes things up by incorporating different types of exercises, like yoga stretches or core workouts, so it never feels monotonous.</p>
<p>I've noticed significant benefits since I started these workouts. I've become more <strong>energetic</strong>, and my <strong>endurance</strong> has improved considerably. Additionally, it's been great for my <strong>mental health</strong>, especially when I've had a long, stressful day. Following along with someone who's both knowledgeable and enthusiastic really helps me stay consistent and motivated.</p>
<p>In the future, I'd like to explore other fitness routines, but for now, <strong>following this online streamer</strong> is definitely my favorite way to stay fit. It's practical, effective, and, most importantly, enjoyable.</p>

<p>A quiet place I love to go to is my <strong>university library</strong>. It’s a modern, six-story building that was completed two years ago, and it’s one of my favorite spots on campus because of its <mark>peaceful atmosphere and convenient facilities</mark>.</p>
<p>I first discovered the library when I started my second year at university. It’s located near the school canteen, and there’s even a coffee shop on the ground floor, which makes it easy to grab a drink before settling in. The library is incredibly well-designed—each study space is equipped with a power outlet and a desk lamp, and you need to reserve a seat in advance through a smart booking system, which ensures it’s never overcrowded.</p>
<p>I go there almost every day, especially when I need to focus on my studies or complete assignments. The quiet environment helps me concentrate, and I often spend hours reading, writing, or preparing for exams. Sometimes, I also use the library to relax with a book or just enjoy the calm atmosphere.</p>
<p>What I love most about this place is how it combines functionality with comfort.

At the same time, the peaceful ambiance and the convenience of having a coffee shop nearby make it a perfect place to unwind.</p>
<p>Overall, the library is more than just a study space for me—it’s a <mark>sanctuary</mark> where I can focus, recharge, and feel productive. It’s definitely one of the best places on campus, and I’m grateful to have such a quiet and well-equipped space to go to.</p>

<p>I'd like to talk about a time when the <strong>kitchen tap</strong> in our home broke, and I managed to fix it on my own. It wasn't anything too complicated, but it was definitely a challenge at first, especially since I had never attempted any plumbing repairs before.</p>
<p>One day, while I was washing dishes, I noticed that the tap was leaking, and water kept dripping even after turning it off completely. This was not only wasteful but also pretty annoying, so I decided to <mark>take matters into my own hands</mark>. At first, I thought about asking my parents to call a plumber, but then I figured it would be a good learning experience to try and fix it myself.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was watch a couple of <strong>tutorial videos</strong> online to understand the basics of how a tap works and what might be causing the issue. After some research, I realized that the problem was most likely a <strong>worn-out washer</strong> inside the tap. Luckily, we had a set of basic tools and some spare washers at home.</p>
<p>I turned off the water supply and carefully <strong>unscrewed the tap handle</strong>. I was a bit nervous at first, worried that I might make the problem worse, but I managed to remove the faulty washer and replace it with a new one. Once I put everything back together and turned on the water supply again, I was thrilled to see that the leak had stopped!</p>
<p>Honestly, fixing the tap gave me a real sense of accomplishment. It wasn't just about saving the cost of hiring a professional, but also about gaining the confidence to handle small repairs around the house. Plus, it felt good to be able to contribute to maintaining our home, especially since I'm usually not very handy with tools.</p>
<p>In conclusion, what started as a minor household inconvenience turned into a valuable learning experience. It made me realize that with the right resources and a bit of patience, even a teenager like me can handle simple repairs.</p>

<p>What it is for</p>
<p>Why you don't like it</p>
<p>And explain why you would like to change it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One rule that I strongly disagree with and would love to change is the annual physical fitness test that all students in Chinese universities are required to take, except for those with physical disabilities. This rule <mark>mandates</mark> that every student must meet a certain fitness standard in order to graduate, and I find it <mark>not only unreasonable but also counterproductive in some ways</mark>.
First of all, the idea of having a unified fitness standard for all students is simply unrealistic. Every individual's health condition and fitness level are different, and this rule fails to take that into account. For example, I myself am not particularly good at physical activities due to issues with my respiratory system. During physical exercises, I often experience significant pain and discomfort, especially when I engage in endurance activities like running. This makes it extremely hard for me to <mark>meet the required fitness benchmarks</mark>. On the other hand, there are students who are naturally more athletic and enthusiastic about sports, and for them, this test might even feel like a fun challenge. The idea of applying the same standard to everyone is, in my opinion, unscientific and unfair.
Furthermore, I believe that this physical fitness test erodes students'quality of life and freedom. University life should be about personal growth and exploration, but the pressure to meet an arbitrary fitness standard can lead to unnecessary stress. Instead of encouraging a healthy lifestyle, it often forces students into routines that may not be suitable for their individual needs. For students like me, who may have physical discomfort during <mark>strenuous</mark> activities, this rule can lead to feelings of inadequacy or even worsen their health problems. In the long run, it may also contribute to the development of negative attitudes towards fitness.
The rule also seems outdated in today's world, where universities are increasingly focusing on personalized education and promoting mental well-being alongside physical health. Instead of <mark>imposing a one-size-fits-all fitness test</mark>, I believe universities should take a more individualized approach. For instance, students could be given a choice to take fitness assessments that align with their personal health conditions or interests, such as offering alternative activities like yoga, swimming, or even mental health workshops for those who struggle with physical challenges.</p>

<p>How you knew this city</p>
<p>And explain why you think it is very interesting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, I'd like to talk about an <strong>interesting city</strong> worth visiting — <strong>Shanghai</strong>. It is located on the eastern coast of China. Shanghai is not only one of the largest cities in the world but also one of the most <mark>vibrant and diverse</mark>. It seamlessly blends <strong>traditional Chinese culture</strong> with modern, cutting-edge development, making it a truly fascinating place to explore.</p>
<p>One of the things that immediately struck me about Shanghai is its <strong>iconic skyline</strong>, especially the area known as the <strong>Bund</strong>. On one side, you have historic colonial-era buildings, and on the other, the futuristic skyscrapers of <strong>Pudong</strong>, like the <strong>Oriental Pearl Tower</strong> and the <strong>Shanghai Tower</strong>, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world. At night, the cityscape lights up with colorful displays, creating a breathtaking view.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting about Shanghai is its unique blend of <strong>old and new</strong>. For instance, you can visit the ancient <strong>Yu Garden</strong>, which dates back to the Ming Dynasty, and within minutes, you can find yourself in the bustling, high-tech shopping district of <strong>Nanjing Road</strong>. It's a city where tradition and modernity <mark>coexist harmoniously</mark>, offering a rich cultural experience.</p>
<p>Another thing I absolutely love about Shanghai is its <strong>diverse food scene</strong>. Whether you're sampling street food like the famous <strong>xiaolongbao</strong>, which are juicy soup dumplings, or dining at upscale restaurants, there's something for every <em>palate</em>. The city is also known for its vibrant nightlife, with trendy bars and rooftop lounges that offer stunning views of the cityscape.</p>
<p>Personally, I find Shanghai inspiring because it's constantly evolving while still preserving its rich cultural heritage. It's a city that reflects China's rapid modernization but also honors its past. It's a place that leaves a lasting impression and makes you want to return again and again. For anyone looking to experience the best of what a modern metropolis can offer, Shanghai is definitely a must-visit destination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, I'd like to share a story that my mom told me while I was away at school. It's about our <strong>French Bulldog</strong>, Gama, and his funny encounters with the neighborhood <strong>cats</strong>. It was really funny that I couldn't stop laughing when hearing it!</p>
<p>So, here's what happened. Gama is a curious little guy—full of energy and always eager to explore. One day, my mom took him out for his usual walk around our neighborhood. As they were strolling down a street, they came across a group of three or four cats <mark>lounging</mark> in the sun.</p>
<p>Now, Gama, being his usual friendly self, decided to approach them. He perked up（振奋） his little <strong>stubby tail</strong>, wiggling 扭动 his entire backside in excitement as he tried to greet them. However, the cats, being <mark>aloof</mark> 冷淡的 as they often are, weren't too impressed with Gama's enthusiasm. According to my mom, one of the cats even <strong>gave a warning hiss</strong>. But instead of getting scared, Gama just tilted his head, almost like he was trying to figure out why they weren't as happy to see him.</p>
<p>My mom was a bit nervous that the situation might <strong>escalate</strong>, but instead of attacking, the cats just stared at Gama, clearly <mark>perplexed.</mark> Eventually, one of the cats, probably the leader, cautiously approached him, gave him a quick sniff, and then walked off as if to say, "You're not worth my time."</p>
<p>What I found most <strong>hilarious</strong>（极其滑稽的 ）about this story is that Gama, despite his confident attitude, ended up looking so puzzled when the cats ignored him. My mom described how he kept tilting his head from side to side with his big watery eyes, trying to make sense of what had just happened. It was like he was <mark>expecting some sort of grand interaction, but got a cold shoulder</mark>.</p>
<p>This story really stuck with me because it perfectly captures Gama's personality—he's always so enthusiastic and eager to make friends, even if the other animals don't quite reciprocate（回应）. Hearing my mom describe it so vividly made me feel like I was right there with them, and it reminded me of how much I miss those little moments with Gama when I'm away. </p>

<p>I'd like to talk about a girl I met recently at my friend's dinner party. It was a gathering where I got the chance to meet a lot of new people, and this particular girl, who sat next to me, really stood out. We started talking almost immediately, and from the very first conversation, I could tell that <mark>we clicked.</mark> She was incredibly friendly, outgoing, and easy to talk to, and it felt like we were on the same wavelength. We just “got” each other, and the conversation flowed effortlessly.</p>
<p>What really intrigued me about her was that she was a professional traveler, and at the time, she had already traveled to over 40 different countries. She shared some of fascinating travel stories I'd ever heard. I could tell she was a great storyteller because I was completely <mark>captivated</mark> by everything she said. Her stories weren't just about the places she visited; they were filled with details about the people she met, the cultures she experienced, and the unique moments that made each trip memorable. I was absolutely engaged throughout our conversation, and I couldn't help but feel inspired by her adventures.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed talking to her because, first of all, I'm someone who loves traveling too, so we had that in common. I found her experiences both exciting and educational. She was also incredibly knowledgeable about the world in general, not just travel. It was clear that she had a deep understanding of different cultures, global issues, and various ways of life. This made her very <mark>charismatic</mark>, as she didn't just talk about herself, but also shared insights and interesting facts about the world.</p>
<p>What I appreciated the most about her, though, was how humble she was. Despite having traveled so much and experienced so many things, she didn't <strong>come across as</strong> pretentious or self-centered at all. It's common to meet people who have had extensive life experiences and for them to be a bit arrogant or always turn the conversation back to themselves. But she was the complete opposite. She was a great listener and was genuinely interested in what I had to say. I felt like she cared about my stories, too, and that made me admire her even more.</p>
<p>Since we only met that once, I've been really curious to get to know her better. I would love to hear more about her travels and learn from her perspectives on life, as she seemed so open-minded and wise. I also think she could teach me a lot about staying humble and grounded, despite achieving so much. So, I definitely hope to see her again and continue our conversation.</p>

<p>Describe a course that impressed you a lot</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What the course was about</p>
<p>Where you took the course</p>
<p>And explain why it impressed you a lot</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One course that left a lasting impression on me was actually a <strong>physical education class</strong> I took a while ago, rather than a traditional academic lesson. It was a team-building exercise that was both fun and incredibly insightful. The highlight of this class was a game called "<strong>Tongxin Drum</strong>," which translates to "United Drum." This activity was designed to <mark>enhance our teamwork and collaboration skills</mark>.</p>
<p>The setup was quite <strong>simple yet challenging</strong>. We were divided into groups of eight, with each person positioned at a different point around a large, circular drum. The drum was suspended in the air by eight ropes, each held by one of us. In the middle of the drum, there was a ball, and our task was to <mark>move together in perfect coordination</mark> to bounce the ball continuously without letting it fall off. The goal was to see how many times we could bounce the ball in a row.</p>
<p>What impressed me the most about this class was how it forced us to <strong>work together seamlessly</strong>. At first, it seemed like a straightforward task, but it turned out to be much more challenging than we expected. Each of us had to maintain just the right amount of tension on our ropes, and even the slightest movement by one person would affect the entire drum. We quickly realized that in order to succeed, we needed to <strong>communicate clearly and synchronize our movements</strong>. It was an excellent way to understand the importance of teamwork because if even one person was out of sync, the ball would fall off almost immediately.</p>
<p>This course not only improved our physical coordination but also taught us valuable lessons about <mark>collaboration and trust</mark>. I remember feeling a great <strong>sense of accomplishment</strong> when we finally managed to keep the ball bouncing for more than 30 times in a row. It required <strong>patience, quick thinking, and a lot of encouragement</strong> from each other. The experience was both fun and rewarding, and it brought us closer as a group.</p>
<p>What made this class particularly memorable was how it combined physical exercise with practical life skills. It was <strong>a refreshing break from the usual sports activities</strong>, and it showed me that even something as simple as moving in sync with others can teach us a lot about teamwork, trust, and communication. To this day, I remember that lesson whenever I'm working in a group setting because it reminded me how crucial it is to listen, adapt, and support each other.

<p>Ok, so, today I'd like to talk about an interesting old person I met at my grandma's dinner party. She's my grandma's good friend, Mrs. Li.
At that dinner, Mrs. Li was sitting right next to me, therefore, naturally we started talking to each other. Surprisingly, despite the age difference, we had a lot of things in common（尽管年龄不同，有很多共同之处）. For example, we both loved traveling, watercolour painting and yoga! That's why we <mark>hit it off</mark>（投机） right away, which was incredible.
She was a professional traveler（职业旅行家）, and she had traveled to more than 40 different countries at that time. She shared with me a lot of fascinating stories. She was indeed a great story teller. I was so engaged（听故事时被深深吸引）. 
I really enjoyed the conversation with her, because, first off, I love traveling. I loved listening to her traveling stories. She was a very <mark>open, chatty and charismatic</mark> person, at the same time, very knowledgeable with the world（对全世界的知识很博学多闻）. So, I really admired her. And secondly, she was 0 pretentious（装逼的） or self-centred（自我为中心）. You know how sometimes people who have seen and done a lot in life tend to be very arrogant and ego-centric（傲慢且自我）, and they make everything about themselves（一切话题都是关于他们的）? Mrs. Li was not like that at all. On the contrary, she was a great listener（善于倾听）, and she cared about my stories. She was humble and down-to-earth. 
So, yeh, that's the person I met at a dinner party. Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I were to buy a gift for my friend Anna, I would choose a DIY wooden assembly model, specifically one called chocolate factory. Anna has always been someone who loves DIY projects and is incredibly <strong>crafty</strong>, so I think this would be the perfect gift for her. She enjoys hands-on activities that allow her to build or create something from scratch, and this model would definitely <strong>capture her interest</strong>.</p>
<p>The chocolate factory model is a unique and intricate design. It's made from high-quality wood, and the pieces are laser-cut, which makes it very precise and easy to assemble.  The model actually has <strong>moving parts</strong>. Once completing the assembly,  we can see marbles, served as chocolate beans, roll through the structure, mimicking the process of chocolate being made in a factory. There are little gears and mechanisms that make the marbles move along a track, and when it's all put together, the factory <strong>comes to life in a fun and charming way</strong>.</p>
<p>I think Anna would absolutely love this gift for several reasons. First, she enjoys <strong>working with her hands</strong>, so assembling this model would be a fun challenge for her. The fact that it's a chocolate factory theme would also appeal to her because she has a <strong>sweet tooth</strong>, and the idea of creating something that's related to chocolate is quite fitting. Secondly, I know that she appreciates gifts that are <strong>thoughtful and personalized</strong>, and this one would show that I understand her hobbies and interests.</p>
<p>Moreover, this model would serve as both a <strong>relaxing activity</strong> and a <strong>decorative</strong> piece once it's completed. It's the kind of thing that she could proudly <strong>display</strong> on her shelf, and every time she looks at it, she'd remember the fun process of building it. I can imagine her spending hours working on it, and I'm sure she'd enjoy every step of the journey, from the assembly to watching the marbles roll.</p>
<p>Overall, I think a DIY wooden chocolate factory assembly model would be a wonderful gift for Anna. It's not only creative and fun, but it also aligns perfectly with her interests. I'm sure she'd appreciate the thoughtfulness behind it and enjoy the experience of building it.</p>

<p>You should say:</p>
<p>Who this person is</p>
<p>How you knew him/ her</p>
<p>What type of work he/ she does</p>
<p>And explain why you think he/ she contributes to the society</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, I'd like to talk about <strong>Zhang Guimei</strong>, a truly inspiring individual who has made a remarkable impact on society. Zhang is a Chinese educator and the founder of the <strong>Huaping High School for Girls</strong>, which was the first free high school exclusively for girls in China. Her dedication to education, especially for underprivileged girls in rural areas, <mark>is nothing short of extraordinary</mark>.</p>
<p>Zhang Guimei has spent <strong>over two decades</strong> working tirelessly in the remote, mountainous regions of Yunnan province, where many families face economic difficulties. The area she chose to work in is incredibly <mark>impoverished</mark>, and girls there are often forced to drop out of school due to financial constraints or societal expectations. What's truly commendable about her work is that she not only focuses on providing free education but also <strong>personally visits</strong> families to persuade them to allow their daughters to attend school. In some cases, she even uses her own limited income to help pay for students' expenses.</p>
<p>Her efforts have <strong>transformed countless lives</strong>. Many of her students, who would have otherwise been confined to a life of hardship, have gone on to pursue higher education and secure stable careers. Zhang's selflessness has not only <mark>empowered individual girls</mark> but also <mark>uplifted entire families and communities</mark>.</p>
<p>What I find most inspiring about Zhang Guimei is her relentless <strong>commitment to social equality</strong>. Despite battling health issues, including cancer, she continues to devote her life to ensuring that girls from impoverished backgrounds have access to education. She firmly believes that education is the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, and her actions reflect that belief.</p>
<p>In recognition of her contributions, she has received numerous national awards, including being named one of the “<strong>People's Role Models</strong>” in China. However, I think what truly sets her apart is her genuine compassion and her willingness to <strong>sacrifice her own well-being for the greater good</strong>.</p>
<p>To sum up, Zhang Guimei is a true inspiration and a shining example of how one person's dedication and hard work can change society for the better. Her story reminds us that, with enough passion and determination, we can all <mark>make a positive difference</mark> in the world.</p>

<p>Describe a time you used your cellphone/smartphone to do something important</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>What happened</p>
<p>When it happened</p>
<p>How important the cellphone/smartphone was</p>
<p>And explain how you felt about the experience</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd like to talk about a time when I used my smartphone to do something really important. This happened just a few months ago during a offline academic lecture. It was an important session for one of my courses, and I was relying on my laptop to take notes. But, unfortunately, halfway through the lecture, my laptop suddenly ran out of battery. I hadn't realized it was so low, and I didn't have my charger with me at that moment.</p>
<p>At first, I panicked because I didn't want to miss any <mark>critical information</mark> from the lecture. It was a session led by a guest lecturer, so I knew it wasn't something that would be easily repeated. That's when I decided to use my smartphone to <mark>salvage the situation</mark>. I quickly took out my phone, using the notes app to <mark>jot down key points</mark>.</p>
<p>What really surprised me was how effective my phone turned out to be for taking notes. Of course, the screen was much smaller than my laptop's, but the phone's keyboard was responsive, and I was able to type relatively quickly. I even found it convenient to use voice typing for some parts, which allowed me to capture information even faster. Additionally, I could switch between apps seamlessly to check references and details the lecturer mentioned during the talk.</p>
<p>In the end, I managed to take detailed notes without missing much of the lecture, which was <strong>a huge relief</strong>. I was actually proud of myself for staying calm and adapting to the situation. I realized that my phone is more than just a device for communication or entertainment; it's a powerful tool that can be incredibly useful in unexpected situations.</p>
<p>After that experience, I made it a habit to keep my phone fully charged during important events, and I've even started using it more often for taking notes or accessing online resources when I'm on the go. It was a lesson in being resourceful and making the most of what I had at the moment. It might have been a small incident, but it definitely left a lasting impression on how versatile smartphones can be for academic purposes.</p>

<p>What the skill is</p>
<p>Who you learned it from</p>
<p>How you learned it</p>
<p>And how you feel about it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One skill that I learned from an older person is <strong>how to make rice dumplings</strong>, which I learned from my grandmother. In my culture, rice dumplings, or "zongzi" as we call them, are traditionally made to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, and it's a skill that's been passed down through generations.</p>
<p>I first learned this skill a few years ago when I visited my grandmother during one of my school holidays. Growing up, I had always been fascinated by how she would so effortlessly wrap the dumplings with bamboo leaves, filling them with sticky rice, red beans, and pieces of marinated meat（腌肉）. So, one day, I asked her to teach me how to make them, and she was more than happy to <mark>pass on her knowledge</mark>.</p>
<p>The process was much more <strong>challenging</strong> than I had anticipated. First, my grandmother showed me how to <strong>soak the sticky rice overnight</strong>（将糯米浸泡一夜） and prepare the fillings, making sure they were <mark>well-seasoned</mark>（把馅料调味好）. The most difficult part, though, was <strong>folding the bamboo leaves into a neat triangular shape</strong> and securing them with string. My initial attempts were clumsy; the leaves would slip, and the filling would <strong>spill out.</strong> However, my grandmother was very patient. She guided me step by step, demonstrating how to fold the leaves tightly and tie the string so that the dumplings wouldn't fall apart during boiling.</p>
<p>What I really appreciated about learning this skill from my grandmother was not just mastering the technique but also hearing the <strong>stories and traditions</strong> behind it. She shared how her mother taught her, and how, back in the day, families would gather to make these dumplings together, turning it into a cherished tradition. It made me realize that making rice dumplings isn't just about the food itself, but also about <strong>family bonding and preserving cultural heritage</strong>.</p>
<p>Since learning this skill, I've tried making rice dumplings on my own a few times, especially during the Dragon Boat Festival, to share with friends and family. Although I'm not nearly as skilled as my grandmother, I've definitely improved. What makes me happiest is seeing the smiles on people's faces when they taste the dumplings I've made—it's a small way for me to <strong>keep our family tradition alive</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking back, I'm grateful for the time I spent with my grandmother learning this skill. It's not just a practical cooking technique but also a <strong>connection to my roots</strong> and a way to honor the past. I hope to continue making rice dumplings and maybe one day pass on this skill to younger members of my family.</p>

<p>I'd like to talk about a trip I once took to the countryside outside of St. Petersburg, Russia. It was during the summer a few years ago when I had the opportunity to visit this <mark>serene and picturesque area</mark>. </p>
<p>The place I visited was a small village called Pavlovsk. It's famous for its <mark>stunning imperial park and palace</mark>, which were once the summer residence of the Russian Tsars. The village itself had an old-world charm, with quaint（古色古乡的） wooden houses, gardens bursting with colorful flowers, and narrow, winding roads. It was such a refreshing change from the busy and bustling city life of St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>What struck me most about the countryside there was how peaceful and quiet it was. As I walked along the park's shaded paths, I could hear nothing but <mark>the rustle of leaves and birds chirping</mark>. The air was incredibly fresh, and the scent of pine trees and wildflowers was everywhere. A lake in the park is surrounded by tall birch trees reflected in the calm, mirror-like water. It felt like I was stepping back in time to a simpler, more relaxed era.</p>
<p>I also had the chance to interact with some of the locals, who were warm and welcoming. They even invited me to try some traditional Russian dishes, like blini and borscht, made from fresh ingredients grown in their gardens. This experience made the trip even more memorable because it gave me a glimpse into their way of life, which is so deeply connected to nature.</p>
<p>Overall, visiting the countryside near St. Petersburg was a truly unforgettable experience. It gave me a much-needed break from the city's fast-paced environment and allowed me to <mark>immerse myself in the natural beauty and history of the area</mark>. I would love to go back one day, especially in autumn when the leaves change color, as I imagine it would be even more breathtaking.</p>

<p>One job that I believe is incredibly useful to society is that of a <strong>teacher</strong>. Teachers play a vital role in shaping the future by educating and guiding young minds, and their impact extends far beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Teachers come from diverse backgrounds, but they generally share certain qualities, such as patience, dedication, and a passion for helping others. They work with students of all ages, from young children in primary schools to adults in universities or vocational training programs. Regardless of the level they teach, their primary goal is to <mark>impart knowledge, foster critical thinking, and inspire their students to reach their full potential</mark>.</p>
<p>I think this job is extremely useful to society because <mark>education is the foundation of progress</mark>. Teachers not only teach academic subjects but also help students develop essential life skills, such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. They also play a key role in shaping values and attitudes, which contributes to building a more informed, responsible, and compassionate society.</p>
<p>Moreover, teachers often go beyond their job description by acting as mentors and role models. For example, during my high school years, one of my teachers noticed I was struggling with confidence and took the time to encourage me. Her support had a lasting impact on me, and it’s something I’ll always remember.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe teachers are <mark>indispensable</mark> to society because they <mark>empower</mark> individuals and, in turn, contribute to the overall development of communities and nations. Their work may not always be <mark>glamorous</mark>, but its long-term impact is <mark>immeasurable</mark>.</p>

<p>Describe a place you have been to and would like to recommend others to live there (not your hometown)</p>
<p>You should say:</p>
<p>Where it is</p>
<p>What the place is like</p>
<p>When you visited there</p>
<p>Who you went there with </p>
<p>And explain why you would recommend this place to others</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One place I’d highly recommend others to live in is <strong>Hangzhou</strong>, a beautiful city in eastern China. I’ve been living here for the past few years as it’s where my university is located, and it has truly become a second home to me.</p>
<p>Hangzhou is known for its stunning natural scenery, rich history, and modern amenities. The city is famous for <strong>West Lake</strong>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is surrounded by picturesque mountains, ancient temples, and lush gardens. The lake area is perfect for leisurely walks, cycling, or simply relaxing while enjoying the view. Beyond West Lake, Hangzhou also has a vibrant urban area with shopping malls, cafes, and tech hubs, making it a perfect blend of tradition and modernity.</p>
<p>I first visited Hangzhou when I started university, and I’ve explored the city extensively since then. I’ve been to West Lake countless times, often with my classmates or friends. We’ve also visited nearby attractions like <strong>Lingyin Temple</strong> and <strong>Xixi National Wetland Park</strong>, which are equally breathtaking. One of my favorite memories is taking a boat ride on West Lake during sunset—the scenery was absolutely magical.</p>
<p>I would recommend Hangzhou to others because <mark>it offers an exceptional quality of life</mark>. The city is clean, safe, and well-organized, with excellent public transportation. It’s also a great place for both work and leisure, as it’s a major tech and innovation hub while still maintaining its natural beauty and cultural charm. Additionally, the people here are friendly and welcoming, which makes it easy to feel at home.</p>
<p>In short, Hangzhou is a city that has something for everyone—whether you’re a nature lover, a history enthusiast, or someone looking for a dynamic urban lifestyle. It’s a place I’ve grown to love, and I’m sure others would too.</p>

<p>Describe an invention that has changed the world in a positive way</p>
<p>You should say</p>
<p>What it is</p>
<p>What benefits it has brought</p>
<p>How it influences people of different ages</p>
<p>And explain how it changed people's lives</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One invention that has undoubtedly changed the world in a positive way is the <strong>electric light bulb</strong>, famously developed by Thomas Edison. This invention <mark>revolutionized</mark> the way people live and work, and its impact is still felt today.</p>
<p>The electric light bulb brought countless benefits to society. Before its invention, people relied on candles, oil lamps, or gas lights, which were <mark>not only dim but also hazardous and inconvenient</mark>. The light bulb provided a safer, brighter, and more reliable source of light, allowing people to extend their productive hours well into the night. This was particularly transformative for industries, as factories could operate around the clock, boosting productivity and economic growth.</p>
<p>The influence of the light bulb spans across all age groups. For children, it means being able to study or read at night, which has greatly improved education and literacy rates. For working adults, it has enabled longer working hours and more efficient workspaces. Even for the elderly, it has improved safety and comfort at home, reducing the risks associated with older lighting methods like open flames.</p>
<p><mark>On a broader scale</mark>, the electric light bulb has fundamentally changed people’s lives. It has made cities brighter and safer at night, contributing to the development of modern urban life. It has also <mark>paved the way for other electrical inventions</mark>, as it was one of the first practical applications of electricity. Without the light bulb, the world as we know it—with its 24/7 activity and technological advancements—would not be possible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the electric light bulb is an invention that has had a profound and lasting impact on humanity. It has improved safety, productivity, and quality of life for people of all ages, and its legacy continues to shine brightly in our modern world.</p>

<p>Ok, off the top of my head（首先想到的）, I’m thinking about my experience of learning how to bake a cake through an online video on social media. </p>
<p>I’m not much of a baker, but I had a very good friend’s birthday coming up, and I thought, why not give it a try（为什么不试试呢）?  I found this short tutorial （教程）on TikTok, maybe around 10 minutes long, where the chef explained everything step by step（一步步）in such a clear and easy way. I watched it at home on my phone and decided to follow the steps.</p>
<p>The video covered everything（包含了所有事情）, from how to properly whisk the eggs（打鸡蛋） to how to fold in the flour without overmixing（掺水和面，避免比例失衡）, which is super important for getting that light, fluffy texture（轻盈、松软的质地）. I also learned how to decorate the cake once it’s done. I learned lot of things. Thank God it was easy to follow.</p>
<p>I followed the recipe step by step religiously（虔诚地一步步跟下来）, and to my surprise（让我惊喜的是）, the cake turned out great! It was light, soft, airy（轻盈、绵软、透气的）, and most importantly, delicious. Honestly, I didn’t build/ get my hopes up（没有把期待设高） too much because it was my first time baking a cake from scratch（从头开始）, but the video made it feel pretty easy. It gave me confidence to try baking more in the future.</p>
<p>So yeah, I was really proud of the result. And, my friend/ girlfriend loved it, which made me over the moon（开心坏了）! Thank you!</p>

<p>Ok, so I’d like to talk about my cousin. She’s a few years older than me, and ever since we were kids, I’ve always seen her with a book in hand. She’s what people would call a real bookworm（书虫）. I mean, even when we 
were all outside playing, she’d be sitting in a corner with her nose buried in some novel（鼻子埋在某一部小说里）.
I first noticed this when I was around 10, and she was already reading these thick books from cover to cover（从头到尾）, like 300-400 pages long. That was quite impressive for me at that age. I was still reading comic books（漫画书） at that time, haha!
And in terms of what she likes to read, well, over the years, I’ve gotten to know her taste in books a bit better. She’s really into a mix of things, from classic literature（经典名著） to more modern stuff like sci-fi, fantasy and crime（科幻、魔幻、犯罪）. But she’s not picky（挑剔的）. She’ll read anything, as long as it’s well-written and thoughprovoking（写得很好且 惹人深思）. 
Finally, speaking of the reason she is so well-read（饱读诗书）, I think she’s just naturally curious and knowledge-driven（向往知识）. She’s always looking to learn new things, and books are her way of exploring different ideas and worlds. Additionally, I guess it’s her way of relaxing, you know? Some people watch TV or scroll through their phones; she just dives into a book and can spend hours in there. And more she reads, the easier it is for her to finish a book with full concentration. I guess it’s like training. She’s been training her “reading muscles” her whole life, haha!</p>
